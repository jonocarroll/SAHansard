      <span class="Normal-H">I thank honourable colleagues for their input and consideration yesterday with [Broke-2], which I have withdrawn after what I thought were some very sensible comments on that amendment and suggestions that perhaps there was another way that could bring about a more balanced outcome with respect to my intent.</span>

        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />After deliberating on that for some time, yesterday I filed amendment No. 1 [Broke‑3]. Effectively, to summarise, the amendment says that if all things are equal in the consideration of the wellbeing of the child for adoption and do not take away from whatever the situation is of that family or partnership or relationship, and the best interests of the child are for the child to be adopted by any prospective adoptive parents or parent, the prospective adoptive parents living together as husband and wife or de facto husband and wife would then have priority over any other prospective adoptive parent or parents on the register or subregister. That is the intent of this amendment in a nutshell, and I ask the chamber to consider it.</span>

Mr Brokenshire's amendment yesterday and I have now been looking at what we are currently looking at. I have a question for the Hon. Mr Brokenshire. How would you propose that the priority the chief executive must give when selecting prospective adoptive parents, as you have described and as proposed by this amendment, would operate in practice?</span>

        <span class="MemberUpper-H">The Hon. R.L. BROKENSHIRE:</span>  I thank the honourable member for his question. Obviously, I am not the chief executive, nor will I ever be the chief executive considering this matter with the relevant people the chief executive would have around her or him. Under the current legislation, without this amendment, they have to prioritise the matter around the request for adoption of that child. In the objects of the act, as I read out yesterday, there are clear objectives that state what the chief executive must consider, the key point being the best interests of that child.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />When the executive has considered and weighed up all of that, if there are three or four families that are being considered for that adoption, then, just like they have to make a decision on those three or four families for all the other reasons, ultimately, if they all line up equally and there is one couple that is same-sex and one couple that is heterosexual, so that they would be offering a situation where there is an adoptive mother and an adoptive father, then they would have priority after the chief executive has considered everything else. I am sure they have a template already on how they look at matching up and consider the welfare of the child.</span>

        <span class="MemberUpper-H">The Hon. S.G. WADE:</span>  I would like to start a separate line of questioning so that I can understand how the agency has to work with this act. I appreciate that we are dealing with very low numbers. I think the minister advised us that there had been zero to three in recent years, so in the statistical sense there is probably no significance in this. Could the minister advise the committee how many of the adoptions that are being made in the modern era would be 'known adoptions', I think they are called, and whether known adoptions include foster carers as well as relatives or whether relatives are a separate category? If they are a separate category, what would the breakdown be?</span>

        <span class="MemberUpper-H">The Hon. I.K. HUNTER:</span>  Before I answer the question posed by the Hon. Mr Wade, I will put on the record some updated information so that we do not need to use the zero to three anymore. I provided an estimate yesterday which was in the range of zero to three in recent years. As at 6 December 2016, there were three couples on the register seeking to adopt a local child and another 10 couples going through the recruitment process. In terms of intercountry adoptions, there are currently 100 couples on the register seeking to adopt a child from another country. That gives us a bit more precision so that we know what we are dealing with.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />In answer to the Hon. Mr Wade's question in terms of adoptions in recent years and what he referred to as 'known adoptions', the categories include all those that he listed, but I am advised that there has not been a foster care adoption in over a decade. I am also advised that a court is unlikely, except in very exceptional circumstances I suppose, to grant adoption to existing relatives because it would change the family relationship for the child, so that is not a standard process, I understand. Most adoptions that are currently known as known adoptions are step-parent adoptions.</span>

        <span class="MemberUpper-H">The Hon. I.K. HUNTER:</span>  My advice is there were two adoptions this year, two adoptions last year and one the year before, so we are still in the range of zero to three. To give you a rough idea of the proportion, I am advised that, if we are talking zero to three, there may be one step-parent adoption and the other two would be infants surrendered to parents not known to the infant's immediate family, for example, so not a known adoption.</span>

        <span class="MemberUpper-H">The Hon. S.G. WADE:</span>  The reason I am asking this is that, as I understand it, Mr Brokenshire's amendment deals with people coming from the register, but the adoptive parent may not be somebody from the register. They may be known to the child in some other way, and the agency makes an assessment that it is in the best interests of the child for the child to be with somebody who is known. If that is my line of thinking, is it fair to say that Mr Brokenshire's amendment would be relevant to 80 per cent of adoptions because 80 per cent of adoptions relate to potential adoptive parents who are on the register?</span>

        <span class="MemberUpper-H">The Hon. I.K. HUNTER:</span>  Just a little wrinkle in that—it is more likely to be 100 per cent if we are talking about parents on a register. Step-parent adoptions obviously usually go to a step-parent, and they are not on the register; they are not waiting for adoption, for example. All the adoptions that may be classified as 'known adoptions' are probably not adoptions that go to people who are already waiting on the register for adoption.</span>

        <span class="MemberUpper-H">The Hon. S.G. WADE:</span>  That is really my point. The 20 per cent who are known do not even engage the register and therefore will not even engage the potential criteria the Hon. Mr Brokenshire suggests should be in the act, but it still might be relevant for the 80 per cent.</span>

If a relinquishing parent had the view that they did not want their potential child to be adopted to a family of a particular family form, would that be a wish that would be respected by the agency?</span>

        <span class="MemberUpper-H">The Hon. I.K. HUNTER:</span>  My advice is that is currently the situation, and that is captured in regulation 19, which is known as a placement regulation. The relinquishing parent has a large role to play, and the chief executive pays particular attention to that. Of course, the reason is that these days, more than in decades past, the relinquishing parent often has a relationship with the child as they grow up and so it is not in the best interests of the child to place them in a family situation the relinquishing parent would have difficulty engaging with. There, the interests of the child and the interests of the relinquishing parents are taken into account through regulation 19.</span>

WADE:</span>  So, it is not that the wish of the parent trumps other interests but that the parents' potential wish is taken into consideration in the assessment of all the interests. For example, if the relinquishing parent was so removed geographically and in terms of interest that there is unlikely to be engagement with the child, that might therefore be a lesser factor.</span>

        <span class="MemberUpper-H">The Hon. P. MALINAUSKAS:</span>  I would like to continue down the line of questioning the Hon. Mr Wade has pursued. This is particularly important to me in the context of the decision that, to be honest, I am deeply struggling with regarding my vote on this legislation, including this amendment in particular. I have sought out the regulations to which the minister has referred in regard to the role of the relinquishing parent, or the biological parent, in respect of seeing their wishes realised in regard to the type of family arrangement that a child could go into. I want to seek some clarity around that now that I have the regulations in front of me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />My reading of the regulations, and I will happily be corrected if I have misinterpreted any of this, is that the chief executive has to be satisfied that the wishes of the child's birth parent or guardian are taken into account when contemplating an applicant as an adoptive parent. I would seek some clarity in regard to what extent that means that the biological parent has the capacity, in essence, to say, 'I do not want my child to be adopted by a same-sex couple,' and then that being realised.</span>

        <span class="MemberUpper-H">The Hon. I.K. HUNTER:</span>  My advice is that that is so. Relinquishing parents, or the biological parents, almost always have a very high involvement in the determination of where the child they are relinquishing for adoption is placed. Something I was not aware of, which might be of interest to honourable members, is that, in making this determination, the department provides de-identified profiles of adopting couples to relinquishing parents, so that they can choose where they think their child will be best placed. The situation the honourable minister outlined is correct: the chief executive has very high regard to the wishes of the relinquishing parent, to the point where, I am advised, they are almost always adhered to.</span>

        <span class="MemberUpper-H">The Hon. P. MALINAUSKAS:</span>  I thank the honourable minister and his adviser for their answer. Can the minister outline a circumstance where a biological parent indicates that they do not want their child to be adopted by parents of a same-sex couple but where the chief executive would have the authority to overrule that indication and allow a same-sex couple to adopt that child despite the parent's wishes?</span>
    </p>

        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />With your indulgence, Mr Chairman, I should take the opportunity to articulate the context of my question. At the heart of this for me is: who has the moral authority to make these judgements? The Hon. Mr Brokenshire's amendment—I think, with good intent—seeks to establish that one form of relationship is superior to another in respect of a capacity to deliver an outcome for the child. I and others, I think, will reasonably have a very different view about the idea of creating such a distinguishing view.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />Many people—I think, reasonably—would make the assumption or come to the view that a gay or lesbian couple is equally as capable as a heterosexual couple of providing a loving environment in which to raise a child. That point of view in many respects appeals to me, but similarly, the decision is also being looked at in the context of who has the moral authority to deprive the child of having either a mother or a father. Therein lies my struggle. I struggle with the idea that I would form a view or support a piece of legislation or regulation that would say that a lesbian couple or a gay couple is incapable of providing an equally loving relationship as a heterosexual couple.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />I deeply struggle with that concept but, equally, I struggle with the idea that a piece of regulation or legislation I might support would deprive a child of access to either a mother or a father. These are deep questions that I struggle with. On what basis or on what moral authority do I exercise either judgement? Ultimately, that judgement has to rest with the people who have ultimate responsibility for the love and care of a child, and they are the biological parents.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />I am trying to satisfy myself that that responsibility is realised in legislation or in regulation. If a biological parent is deprived of their ability to make that judgement call, then there is a problem and maybe, therefore, Mr Brokenshire's amendment is more palatable in that context. The extent to which I can be satisfied that a biological parent is able to make that incredibly profound judgement will go a long way to informing my view and determining how I vote on this particular amendment and legislation.</span>

        <span class="MemberUpper-H">The Hon. I.K. HUNTER:</span>  I thank the minister for his question and his explanation of his thinking. There are a couple of things I need to say about this to the house. I should say that my adviser is an experienced practitioner in the field of adoption, and so her advice on this is particularly useful for me. She has advised me that, in 22 years of practice, she cannot recall an experience where the department has ignored the wishes of the relinquishing parent in regard to the background, or the family, that the adopted child will be going into.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />The honourable minister asked what is the circumstance—the hypothetical circumstance, in our situation, as it has never happened here because, currently, homosexual couples cannot adopt—that would allow the chief executive to, for example, override a wish by the relinquishing couple that a child not be adopted by a gay couple. There is no circumstance of that here, as I just outlined, but we can look at situations where single people can adopt in this state. Again, as people understand through our debate, we know that is only in exceptional circumstances.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />Exceptional circumstances could be that the child has such significant or high-level needs, perhaps of a medical nature or, as we know through our discussions, of a severe disability nature, where the couple, a gay couple perhaps or, as in past practice, a single person, has particular expertise or medical background in that particular medical situation or disability. Another instance could well be—again, this has not been experienced to date, to my knowledge—an older child who has a cultural and linguistic background that is specific, such as an Indian child who speaks Hindi. It may well be that then the cultural background of the prospective parents, and the language that they speak at home, may be taken into consideration, all other things being considered.</span>

The hypothetical circumstance where that wish would be overridden in terms of a gay couple would really be exceptional, and it would only be in the situations I have outlined where there are very significant high-level needs that could not be met by another parent.</span>

My first question is to the mover of this amendment. I note with interest that his amendment essentially says that, if all things are equal—if we have a same-sex couple and a different-sex couple and their material, emotional and financial ability to care for a child or young person is the same—then preference should be given to the heterosexual couple.</span>
    </p>

      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />My question to the mover in terms of his understanding of the impact of the amendment is: if all things are equal, then are not all things equal? If both these couples have the same ability, in terms of their resources and stability of family structure, to take care of the child, then what is the real-world impact of the mover's amendment in terms of why it is still preferential that they go to a heterosexual couple even if there is the same ability to care for the child, all things being equal?</span>

        <span class="MemberUpper-H">The Hon. R.L. BROKENSHIRE:</span>  I thank the honourable member for her question. The answer to that is I have made this amendment on the basis that if all things are equal, other than the fact that one is a heterosexual couple and one is a same-sex couple, then there are arguments morally, and other arguments as well, depending on what documents you read and what you believe and do not believe, that that child still has a better opportunity if they are in contact with both a mother and a father, as was always the biological intent of how we are created.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />Some people will not like me saying that, but that is the reality. If it is all lined up and it gets to that point, then I have moved this amendment because, being a parent myself and watching three adult children grow up, I strongly believe that, probably for the first two years of their lives, all of my children mainly needed to be with their mother. That was the reality. I was not such an important part, although I still had a part to play. Certainly, from two years of age onwards, right up to and including now—with the eldest being 30, and the others 29 and 24, well educated and one a mother herself—they still come and see their mother, or speak to their mother on certain matters, and they still come and see me as their father and speak to me on certain matters.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />I am of the strong belief that if everything else is equal and there is an opportunity for a heterosexual couple to ultimately have that adoption, the reality is, from my amendment, they would have priority at that point in time. If they are not equal and the same-sex couple clearly has attributes that are above the other applicants, then I expect that same-sex couple would be signed off by the chief executive officer. But, where they are absolutely equal, then the point I raise is one which I strongly believe in morally. I have read a lot of documentation and scientific research that shows there is a real benefit in having a mother and a father.</span>

    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />I cannot be more open and honest than that. It is the call of this chamber as to what they ultimately say. I am only one member, but I very strongly and passionately believe in that, and that is why I move this amendment. It is not cutting same-sex couples out of having an opportunity to adopt. A same-sex couple can be loving and caring and give a child everything, but I still stand by my point about the moral issue, the biological intent for us as human beings and the scientific research that shows that a child needs a mother and a father wherever possible.</span>

The honourable member has had plenty of time to do her own research. I am not going to name the studies. To give you one example, if you want to put it on the table right now, in the last two weeks scientific research has been done on the education of children. There is an urgent call to get more males into primary school teaching. That is one example. The reason for that, with all the scientific research, is that there are not enough male teachers in the classroom.</span>

When I was at school, there were plenty of kids who were adopted. It seems that there are fewer who even get the chance for adoption now. There is growth in intercountry adoption, and for whatever reason—and I do not know the reason—there is such a smaller number available for adoption, but we are going to give same-sex couples that opportunity. All I am asking for is one amendment that says, where they do line up, the priority goes to the heterosexual couple. That is all I am asking; it is clear-cut.</span>

Mr Wade, I am advised that Associate Professor Lorna Hallahan did exhaustive literature research for the Adoption Act review in 2015, which she superintended. I am advised she found no convincing evidence in the literature against same-sex parenting, and therefore came up with a recommendation, as we see formulated now in the bill, which does not seek to preference heterosexual couples over homosexual couples.</span>

        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />Whilst I am on my feet, I will again put on the record my opposition to Mr Brokenshire's amendment [Broke-3]. The amendment appears to provide that the chief executive must prioritise a heterosexual couple over a same-sex couple or a single person if comparing more than one prospective parent or set of prospective parents who are equally suitable to adopt a child and are equally able to care for the child in consideration of the child's best interest.</span>

        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />Following the recommendations of the independent review of the Adoption Act and the South Australian Law Reform Institute's audit report into 'Discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, gender, gender identity and intersex status in South Australian legislation', the bill seeks to remove the discriminatory impacts of the Adoption Act. Given the revised status of the honourable member's amendment, the fact remains that the bill seeks to provide that the best interests, welfare and rights of the child, both in childhood and in later life, must be the paramount consideration.</span>

Mr Brokenshire's amendment. If you believe, however, that there is no sound reason to discriminate and if you want to remove the existing discriminatory provisions in the Adoption Act, then you will vote against the Hon. Robert Brokenshire's amendment.</span>

        <span class="MemberUpper-H">The Hon. T.A. FRANKS:</span>  I have an entirely different approach to this particular amendment, aside from the same-sex couples versus heteronormative couples, who are advantaged. Yes, this is a really difficult bill. One of the reasons that rates of adoption are so low is because we have a very dark history on adoption in this country. We have the forgotten Australians. We have people who were taken from single parents, shipped overseas to Australia and given to nice heterosexual families. In fact, they were often put to work as child labour, sexually abused or lived horrific lives in institutions in this country because it was seen that a single parent was not good enough for them in their home country.</span>

That is why, if you read the Hallahan report, there is specific mention made of the adoption of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. I believe this amendment preferences a good white couple over a potential auntie or granny adopting an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander child. This is a live issue because, according to page 23 of the Hallahan report:</span>

        <span class="MemberUpper-H">The Hon. I.K. HUNTER:</span>  In response to the Hon. Tammy Franks's question about Aboriginal adoption, the government has accepted the advice of Associate Professor Lorna Hallahan in her review. As such, Aboriginal child placement principles have been elevated in this bill to give them the recognition that what the Aboriginal community—indeed, the relinquishing parents in many cases, if there are any—would want is a placement in a family situation. Again, that would not only be in the best interests of the child but also maintain their cultural connections. However, my advice is that there has not been an Aboriginal adoption in this state for about 15 years or slightly more.</span>

Section 11(1) of the Adoption Act, which talks about the adoption of an Aboriginal child, provides:</span>

    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">My understanding of that clause is that it is not, shall we say, another factor to throw into the equation for best interests but that it is a separate test. For example, let's take the Aboriginal mother whom I think the Hon. Tammy Franks was referring to and the fact that she had a preference for a non-Aboriginal adoptive parent. That could be overridden by the agency that makes the assessment. I understand the statement that the wishes of the relinquishing parent are not sacrosanct; they are not a veto. In that sense, this clause would make the Aboriginal child placement principle separate from the mix of priorities that go into assessing the best interests of the child and is a second test.</span>

        <span class="MemberUpper-H">The Hon. I.K. HUNTER:</span>  My advice is, I suppose, yes, that is so. However, in practice, particularly in relation to Aboriginal children, I am advised that we would then proceed to ask ourselves whether or not the adoption is in the best interests of the child, and the adoption may not be proceeded with. If there is conflict or tension in making a determination, then the department may look at alternatives, such as perhaps placing them with immediate family, but not an adoptive-type situation.</span>

I do not think that is an easy judgement call for me to make. The real judgement here is to ask: who has the moral authority to make that call? In reality, what the parliament is asking itself today, in the context of the Brokenshire amendment, and later on in the surrogacy bill, is: does the parliament take the view that it has the moral authority to make that judgement on behalf of other constituents?</span>

However, I have arrived at a different conclusion.

With all due respect to the Hon. John Gazzola, who is a noted researcher in the area, I think he was using Google rather than Wikipedia. Be that as it may, could I go back to the minister and ask about the government's collective view? What does the research show in terms of the relevance of the family form in terms of likely outcomes for a child? I do not want to fall back on my legal background and ask you for the level of certainty—are we confident on the balance of probabilities, are we confident beyond reasonable doubt? But this must be emerging research because discrimination against gay couples has been longstanding. If we could get some summary of the current research that would be helpful.</span>

You would go through the assessment report process, meet all the requirements (a) through to (o), provide the assessment and then, if you were to consider an Aboriginal child, it would then be elevating the Aboriginal Child Placement Principles and going through the prospective pool of available adopting couples and testing them, I suppose, against the Aboriginal Child Placement Principles—whether they are part of the same kin group, cultural group, language group or, if they were indeed a non-Aboriginal adopting couple, whether they are prepared to maintain an appropriate cultural connection for that child.</span>

The chief executive gets an assessment report under these principles, and if the Brokenshire amendment passes that is another factor, and some of these factors overlap.

        <span class="MemberUpper-H">The Hon. I.K. HUNTER:</span>  We are having quite a deal of difficulty answering that very technical question, Mr McLachlan. I think the best I can give you is to take you through a stepwise process. According to regulation 9, an adopting couple, a couple who want to adopt, are assessed, and if they meet those requirements they are placed in a pool waiting for a child to come along. If a child does come along, the intention of the act and the practitioners who administer the act would be to find a potential adoptive person, or persons, who meets that child's needs. Then, if that child happens to be Aboriginal, we go to step 3 of the Aboriginal Child Placement Principles. For example, there may be an Aboriginal couple in the adoptive pool who do not meet the criteria of being of the same cultural, kin or language group, and that could cause obvious problems as well.</span>

        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />With regard to your question about the interplay between other subsequent provisions, such as the Hon. Mr Brokenshire's amendment, yes, it presents some difficulties. We cannot really articulate what they might be because they are not presently in the legislation—or nothing similar is in the legislation, as we can recall—but they would have interplay; they could probably work constructively, or possibly not constructively, in terms of the determination. It is very hard to outline, in a technical sense, what might happen, but it would be another factor that could cause problems.</span>

The Hon. Mr Brokenshire's amendment may then work against that placement. However, it is hypothetical, and it is very hard for us to distinguish, given that we have not faced the situation previously.</span>

If on first pass, perhaps, there are a number of couples on the register who seem to be, at first glance, equal in their presentation, then you would dig down further to try to determine what would be the absolutely best placement for that child, because at the end of the day that is what we are seeking to do.</span>

Paul Sullins in the <span class="-H" style="font-style:italic;">British Journal of Education, Society and Behavioural Science</span>. The list goes on. There are at least another 18 to 20 pieces of documentation that have been studied in depth with large numbers. I advise the house of this in answer to a question.</span>

        <span class="MemberUpper-H">The Hon. S.G. WADE:</span>  I do not know if I want to make a declaration, but I am uncomfortable with some of the comments that are being made. I am very attracted to the wording in the bill. Let's remind ourselves that this bill introduces for the first time a set of objects and guiding principles. Subclause (2) of that section is very helpful, first of all, in declaring that the paramount consideration would be the best interests of the child.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />There are also two other elements which I think are important for us to keep in our minds: one, is that adoption is to be regarded as a service for the child concerned. For example, when we discuss the relevance of the interests of a relinquishing parent, with all due respect to relinquishing parents, the adoption is not a service for them; it is a service for the child. That reinforces, if you like, the paramountcy issue.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />On the issue of discrimination, 2(d) says—and in that sense it is a corollary of 2(b)—'no adult has a right to adopt a child'. So, I will be motivated in my voting today exclusively, or overwhelmingly, on paramount consideration. I do not see this as an issue of discrimination of people's rights, other than the rights of the child—I just make that point.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />For me, the issue that the Hon. Robert Brokenshire brings before us, or raises in my mind, is: in considering the best interests of the child, are the facts before us clear enough that we can assume that the traditional form of families in Western society, which is different-sex couples, is prima facie better for children than same-sex couples? My advice, the information the minister has provided and what I am told by different sources, is that, if you like, we have gone beyond the balance of probabilities. I am still not clear how convinced we are, but I am nervous about the fact that we, as a community, have made reckless decisions in relation to children in the past. That is why we, as a state, have been distraught by child protection issues in recent years.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />Based on the information provided to me, I believe that we have reached the point where, for the sake of caution, we do not need to have biased principles such as those the Hon. Robert Brokenshire puts forward. I do not criticise him for putting it forward because I think the onus is on us to be sure that the interests of children are kept paramount and are protected. I know it is a judgement call, but my judgement call is that this priority principle is not needed.</span>

        <span class="MemberUpper-H">The Hon. D.G.E. HOOD:</span>  I thought I might explain to the chamber where we are at with all this. My impression, from the discussion we had yesterday, was that the Hon. Ms Franks and a few other members were open to supporting the amendments I moved—one primary amendment that I moved—but had some discomfort with some phrases, including 'religious beliefs'. I am sure members will recall that we had a discussion about the term 'religious beliefs' in the amendment I moved. I indicated to the chamber that I was happy for that to be removed because it was not my specific intention that it was ever to be put in, to be frank; it was just how the drafting returned from parliamentary counsel, and that is no criticism of them.</span>

      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />I moved an amendment to my amendment to remove the term 'religious beliefs', and that has been filed this morning as [Hood-2], which everyone would have copies of now. That amendment removes the term 'religious beliefs' and nothing more than that. I will let the Hon. Ms Franks explain her amendment in a moment, but I have since been informed that I cannot amend my amendment because I had already moved my amendment. You can amend your amendment if it has not been moved but, as I understand it, I cannot amend it because I had moved it.</span>

It is as simple as that. Is that clear to everyone? It is fairly straightforward. I seek leave to withdraw [Hood-1].</span>

        <span class="MemberUpper-H">The Hon. I.K. HUNTER:</span>  Whilst we are waiting for those amendments to be drafted and tabled, I might take a moment of the chamber's time to put on the record some further information that arises from our debate yesterday in answer to a question asked by the Hon. Mr Hood, and also in relation to a further question asked outside the chamber but which I might as well share with the chamber. If I could go to exemptions under the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, which I think the Hon. Mr Lucas wanted me to pursue, I can advise that Australian jurisdictions were granted an exemption under the commonwealth Sex Discrimination Act.</span>

        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />The exemption was provided under regulations, which would be removed from 2013. At that time, the commonwealth provided a 12‑month extension for states and territories to address the removal of the exemption or to request any specific exemptions that they believed were required. This was extended a couple of times, I am advised, but was not extended beyond 31 July 2016. I am advised by AGD that South Australia did not request any specific exemptions.</span>

        <span class="MemberUpper-H">The Hon. I.K. HUNTER:</span>  In the absence of any exemption, my advice is that South Australia is now subject to this act and any potential claims of discrimination brought against it. Given the risk that the Hood amendments, however they come forward now, may be inconsistent with the Sex Discrimination Act, it is possible that South Australia could request a specific exemption. However, I am advised that granting this exemption would be entirely up to the commonwealth.</span>

        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />I am also advised that, during previous discussions, it did not appear that there was much appetite to make specific exemptions. Therefore, I think the risk remains that the Hon. Dennis Hood's amendments, which are coming, could be found to be inconsistent with the Sex Discrimination Act. I referred to the South Australian Law Reform Institute yesterday. Their initial audit report of September 2015, on page 10, noted:</span>

          <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />There is a degree of urgency in relation to many of the areas covered by this Report as South Australia is currently subject to an exemption by the Commonwealth in respect of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. This exemption is due to expire on 31 July 2016.</span>

        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />In relation to a question asked outside the chamber relating to a child born within a surrogacy arrangement finding out the identity of donor sperm, I am advised that the Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Act 1996 sets out how a child who has been born under a surrogacy arrangement can find out information about the person who provided the semen and the ovum that resulted in their birth. The child's birth registration must include all particulars of the identity of the biological parents of the child. This is set out in section 14 of the BDM act.</span>

I can provide the chamber further advice about information coming back to government in relation to one provider, Repromed. This is what they say:</span>

      <span class="Normal-H">I think the word 'moral' in the Hon. Dennis Hood's amendment is a bridge too far. While I understand the reason for a religious objection, I think a moral objection is too loose a wording. I am aware that the Fair Work Act 1994, with regard to conscientious objection, is restricted to religious belief; the Education Act 1972 is restricted to religious belief in terms of conscientious grounds for exemptions; and medical termination of pregnancy under the Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 is, again, restricted to religious grounds for that objection by the person who is providing the service.</span>

      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />Further, my amendment No. 3 [Franks-3] will insert into the Hood amendment subsection (4), which provides, 'The minister must publish the Register on a website maintained by the Minister for the purpose.' Where a person is to be a registered objector, that information is provided to the minister. The minister publishing that information will mean that somebody seeking an ART service will be able to know, prior to approaching a professional, what the status of that person is with regard to their objection, and therefore give clarity to those people seeking assisted reproductive technologies and save them from going through that process just to be rejected by the provider. In fact, it is a reasonable provision, and I think that people in quite a vulnerable position who are seeking quite a personal service should be afforded that respect and courtesy, let alone those human rights.</span>

I think we canvassed to some degree in the chamber yesterday that it is obviously a very personal thing, the sorts of issues that we are dealing with here, and that it would be a very difficult and undesirable situation if a same-sex couple approached a particular clinic and found out into the process, that is, well after the commencement of the process, that the particular doctor or nurse concerned had a religious objection. I think that would be unreasonable and unfair for those individuals, so we will not be opposing the amendments.</span>

If I am correct, the minister yesterday referred to section 116 of the commonwealth constitution, which provides that commonwealth legislation overrides state legislation where that legislation is inconsistent. Is that actually the situation here? The equal opportunity legislation of each jurisdiction is significantly different; they are not identical. To that extent they are inconsistent, and as far as I know that section 116 issue has not come into play.</span>

        <span class="MemberUpper-H">The Hon. I.K. HUNTER:</span>  We will go back and check on that. I think it was 109. My advice is we would have to check the specific legislation in the Sex Discrimination Act to see if there is any provision that allows for an exemption for religious beliefs in relation to ART. I do not have that advice presently before me, but if there is not, then, yes, there is potentially that opportunity to have inconsistent legislation.</span>

        <span class="MemberUpper-H">The Hon. S.G. WADE:</span>  In the absence of further advice, I will assume that what we are faced with here is not a constitutional invalidity issue but a commonwealth law that purports to apply to the state and its agencies, and that we are currently operating under an exemption under a commonwealth law that has been removed.</span>

        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />I reiterate what I said yesterday, that I support this legislation. I think it is in the best interests of children that as wide a range as possible of ART comes under the act. Having said that, the right of same-sex couples, in particular, to access ART is not inhibited by some ART providers not being willing to provide services in circumstances which offend their religious beliefs. Freedoms and rights constantly interplay and at times we have to balance them.</span>

      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />I think the Hon. Dennis Hood's amendment particularly addresses a concern in relation to a monopoly provider, for example the right of a service provider not to provide a service to a person on the basis of whatever discriminatory criteria they might identify. It might be more limited than that of a service community where there is a large number of providers. Admittedly, in South Australia, we have only two ART providers. However, I stress that this right is not available to the organisation: it is available, as I understand it, to each individual provider. Within Repromed there may be a limited number of practitioners who would, in certain circumstances, seek this protection.</span>

        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />As a Liberal, I am very keen to do the best I can to appropriately balance rights. This amendment may not be perfect, but as I preached, dare I say, to the Hon. Mark Parnell in recent weeks, we are in a bicameral system and there may well be an opportunity to improve the amendment between the two houses or it may be that the amendment is not possible in the context of the commonwealth constitution or the commonwealth Sex Discrimination Act. For me, religious and other freedoms are so important that I would like to keep my foot in the door.</span>

      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />As I articulated in the previous debate, I have spent a fair bit of time and effort, as I am sure all members have, contemplating my position with respect to this bill. What I struggle with, at its core, is the fact that no matter which way I vote on this issue (or each of us votes on this issue), in my assessment, we are making a decision to deprive someone of something. That is not easy. That is not particularly enjoyable.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />If one were to vote in a way that opposed providing access to things like ART to lesbian couples, for instance, that is making a conscious decision to deprive them of the ability to raise their own children in the world. That is a significant thing to deprive someone of. Having recently enjoyed the experience of becoming a parent, it is the greatest responsibility of all, it is a true blessing, and to deprive someone of that is a significant decision to make.</span>

    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />Equally, I find it a tough decision to deprive a child, who is currently voiceless, of a mother or father. That is a huge call. Proponents of these reforms, in response to that challenge, often say, 'Sure, in today's day and age, today's society, kids are being deprived of a mother or father all the time, for a whole range of reasons.' They could be born into a family that does not have a loving marriage or relationship. They could be born into a family with an abusive father or an appalling mother. They could be born into a family that has been struck down by tragedy, resulting in a woman becoming a widow.</span>

      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />There is a whole range of circumstances in society generally that deprive the child of a mother or father—that is true—but for me that in and of itself is not a very strong argument; in fact, I think it is an incredibly weak argument. To cite an unfortunate circumstance in life as somehow a justification for another unfortunate circumstance I think is flawed logic. We have to acknowledge that this has another degree of complexity than the adoption bill because what the parliament is asked to do here is to explicitly sanction an act, which would be a deliberate and conscious act, to deprive a child of being raised by either a mother or father. That is a huge call—that is huge call and one that does not sit well with me at all.</span>

      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />Having said that, in trying to rationalise a decision model to arrive at a view I ask myself a number of different things: firstly, what is in the best interests of the child? As I articulated earlier, I can entirely understand and appreciate and in the past have supported the view that it is always in the best interests of the child to have both a mother and a father. However, I am of the view that it is also true that two mothers or two fathers can provide a loving relationship for a child to be brought up in. On that basis, I ask: who has the moral authority to make this decision? As I articulated earlier, I think ultimately that has to be the parents themselves, rather than a forum or a body such as this one.</span>

    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />My inclination is to support this legislation in the hope that all parents who are making decisions about bringing a child into the world do so in the knowledge that having multiple influences in their life—in the case of lesbians, for instance, which I think this bill particularly speaks to, that is having a father figure in their life, ideally the biological father—would be a positive. I have contemplated how one might structure amendments that would stipulate that that would be mandated, although it starts to become an incredibly difficult exercise to stipulate or mandate that a biological father will play a particular role in their life. If that were simple, then that legislation would have been brought into parliaments across the world a long time ago in respect of fathers in a heterosexual relationship.</span>

      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />I am satisfied that the legislation and the bill provide, as the minister articulated earlier, for a child to have access to their biological father. I am satisfied that an appropriate arrangement is in place that allows for a child to have access to their biological father. I am not sure how that could reasonably be improved. On balance, I am inclined to support the bill. However—and this now goes to the Hon. Mr Hood's amendments—I am extremely concerned, to say the least, about the prospect that someone would be deprived of the ability to exercise their own conscience in the delivery of such services.</span>

        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />My assessment is that those people who are articulating and advocating for the types of reform we have been debating today and over the last few days do so in the name of liberty; they do so in the name of choice. I see the merit of that, so much so that I have been persuaded to support the bill on the basis of allowing people to exercise their own judgement and choice, but to somehow argue for that and then simultaneously argue against the Hood amendments, which would in and of itself deprive someone of exercising their own liberty, I see as nothing other than absolute appalling, rank hypocrisy. In my view, in the context of all these debates, that is often easy to point out, I have to say.</span>

Similarly, that right must be balanced against individuals. We all live life through individual experience and in accordance with our conscience, particularly if we have religious beliefs. I apply a similar test, maybe not identical to that of the Hon. Mr Malinauskas but a similar test, and that is where I will land.</span>

Today, we are talking about the perceived characteristic being the sexuality of that person or perhaps their marital status, and we think, today in this chamber, that it is okay to talk about that—to deny someone services based on their perceived characteristics, their sexuality or perhaps their marital status.</span>

Why is it not okay to discriminate against the provision of service to someone on the basis of their nationality, or their gender, or because of their religious beliefs? That is the road we travel down here. That is why we have achieved today and yesterday, some great successes, in removing discrimination from the face of statute.</span>

Today, we are talking about ART. Yes, I accept that in some people's minds there is a difference with this issue. I absolutely accept that because of the particular characteristics of what the service is doing: it is providing the ability of a couple or an individual to become pregnant.</span>

That is what you are doing if you vote for this amendment. I cannot do that.</span>

        <span class="MemberUpper-H">The Hon. P. MALINAUSKAS:</span>  I might take the opportunity to respond to that because the honourable minister asked: why do we not discriminate against people on the basis of race or nationality or ethnicity or anything along those lines? To me, the answer to that question is very simple—because here we are dealing with something that is far more fundamental. We are dealing with the creation of a new life and the circumstances under which that child will be raised.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />That is a fundamental question and it is a departure from the absolute undeniable reality that, as it will always stand, every child will have a biological father and mother. To depart from that reality is a big step for some people, and I think people of reasonable and good intent can arrive at a conclusion that it is in the best interests of the child to have both a mother and a father.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />People might disagree with that assessment, but they should be able to exercise their right to arrive at that judgement and live their life accordingly. To deprive them of their ability to exercise that judgement is, as I stated earlier, completely hypocritical for those people who genuinely believe in the capacity of people to choose. To act otherwise is to discriminate against their ability to live their life and conduct their life in accordance with their own beliefs, religious or otherwise. That in and of itself is an act of discrimination.</span>

      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />At the core of this amendment, in my view, is: what is the purpose of this bill? Is the purpose of this bill to bestow upon a group of people in society currently who do not have the ability to raise a child under the current legislative framework, or is it to impose the will of a group of people upon others? If this bill is genuinely about giving lesbian couples the capacity to enjoy the privileges of parenthood, then this amendment does not offend anybody, but if this amendment is about imposing upon others a view of the world that you do not agree with, then I think that is shown up in the context of how people vote in this amendment.</span>

Only in the last couple of months, KPMG's report about the cost of doing business in different cities around Australia found Adelaide the cheapest capital city in which to do business—the cheapest capital city. Recently, a review of states' economies found us as the second best performing state economy on a number of other indicators. So, I know the Hon. David Ridgway and many of his mates in this chamber, and many of his mates in the federal parliament, love to talk South Australia down. They are willing South Australia to fail. That's not what we will do. We will support South Australia.</span>

        <span class="GeneralBold-H">):</span>  I thank the honourable member for that most important question. Building Upgrade Finance (BUF), as acknowledged by both houses of parliament, is a very important reform which we hope will boost jobs whilst delivering environmental benefits and improving buildings across the state. Enabling legislation passed the South Australian parliament in December 2015. The remaining elements of the legislative framework, which includes the draft regulations, the draft 'no worse off' methodology for estimating tenant cost savings and the draft Building Upgrade Agreement template, I am advised, are now available for feedback on the state government's YourSAy website.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />By way of background, one-fifth of greenhouse gas emissions, I am advised, come from energy used in buildings, with new development adding less than 5 per cent to our building stock every year. This is why it's important to improve the environmental performance of existing buildings. We know that barriers preventing environmental upgrades to commercial buildings from going ahead include access to capital, as well as the split incentive between landlords and tenants in leased buildings. We covered this pretty well during the debate on BUF in this place, but to assist building owners to overcome the barriers to improving energy, water and environmental performance of existing commercial buildings we have committed to introducing our Building Upgrade Finance mechanism and developing the regulations.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />It's important to remind ourselves that this is going to be a voluntary situation for building owners and financiers and councils to enter into. Implementing Building Upgrade Finance will help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enable us to move towards our goal of making the City of Adelaide carbon neutral. Enabling legislation which provides for the introduction of this mechanism in South Australia passed the parliament in December 2015. This makes South Australia the third jurisdiction in Australia to introduce enabling legislation for such a mechanism, following Victoria and New South Wales.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />The Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources has entered into an agreement, I advise, with the South Australian division of the Property Council of Australia for the delivery of a series of events to increase awareness and understanding of the mechanism within the property and finance sectors in our state. The first event was delivered on 30 August 2016 as a luncheon, with the Premier delivering a keynote address. Further events were delivered on 29 September and 27 October 2016 as boardroom luncheons, targeting financial institutions and property owners respectively. The government is also providing support to local government-led projects which aim to assist local councils with understanding the mechanism.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />We have committed $1.9 million over four years for the establishment and operation of the Building Upgrade Finance in South Australia program. Part of this funding is being used to complete the development of the legislative framework as well as deliver an early adopter program that supports business and industry to build their understanding of and capacity to take up the Building Upgrade Finance. A review of the mechanism in its third year of operation will also be undertaken using some of the funding. This funding will also be used to establish a central administrator. The administrator is expected to support participating councils by undertaking most of the functions associated with the administration of building upgrade agreements, thereby reducing associated costs to councils.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />The delay, then, if there has been one, has really been about our development of the regulations, our consultation on those regulations, as well as those other parts of the mechanism that I talked about, and also the educative component, which is liaising directly with business owners, councils and financial institutions to make sure that they are aware of the legislation and will be able to make the best opportunity of it when those regulations are brought into effect.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />Whilst I am on my feet, I might go to a question I was asked in this place yesterday by the Hon. Mr Lucas about Adelaide versus Melbourne and Carbon Neutral Adelaide. I undertook for someone in my agency to review the document referred to by the Hon. Mr Lucas. In answering the honourable member's question, I did advise that Melbourne's ambitions related to the city council operations rather than to the entire municipality. I am now advised that that view is incorrect.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />There are two initiatives that relate to Melbourne, I am advised. The first is the carbon neutral status, already obtained by the City of Melbourne for the council's operations alone. This has been achieved through the federal National Carbon Offset Standard (NCOS), I am advised. The second initiative from Melbourne relates to net zero emissions for the entire municipality, to which the Hon. Mr Lucas referred in his question. As he remarked, that ambition relates to the entire city—he is quite correct—not just to Melbourne council's emissions alone. So, I apologise to the chamber. That advice I had and relied on was, I assume, correct at the time. My department has now advised me differently and I put that on the record to stand as a correction.</span>

        <span class="MemberUpper-H">The Hon. T.J. STEPHENS:</span>  Under the commonwealth's blackspot program, 3,000 mobile telecommunication blackspots have been identified in Australia, and indeed there are hundreds throughout South Australia. As honourable members may be aware, the government refused to put forward funding for round 1 of the program, yet South Australia still managed to receive funding from the commonwealth for 11 sites, including six in the APY lands. One can only imagine how many more would have been funded had the government got its act together.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />During the estimates committee proceedings earlier this year, the minister admitted that the South Australian government did not commit funding to round 1 of the program because it believed that telecommunications is a responsibility of the commonwealth and therefore any funding should be a commonwealth responsibility. Queensland and Western Australia received the most towers in round 2 of the program, with 76 and 78 respectively.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />Unsurprisingly, those states gave the highest co-investments of $13.7 million and $21.8 million respectively, yet this government offered only $2 million and got 20 sites and complained about it. This information, coupled with the knowledge that, in round 1, New South Wales and Victoria received 144 and 110 blackspot upgrades from contributions of $24 million and $21 million respectively, goes to show that proper funding does lead to outcomes in this particular program.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />The minister has continually stated that it is the commonwealth government that decides which sites are funded and how many. For the council and the minister's benefit, I can confirm that these sites are prioritised based on need and are funded on a value for money basis. This effectively means that sites in more densely populated areas will be prioritised. It has been put to my office that the state Labor government prioritised their preferred sites on tourism rather than on need for resident South Australians. In fact, the minister confirmed this in his answers to the estimates committee earlier this year.</span>

        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />In his answer yesterday, the minister referred to the commonwealth not spending the entire $2 million allocated. It has been confirmed to me that this was because a number of the sites prioritised by the state Labor government were inadequate and uneconomic. As a result, a portion of the funding was returned as it was deemed surplus to need for the identified 20 sites and the commonwealth did not want to waste taxpayer funds.

        <span class="MemberUpper-H">The Hon. K.J. MAHER:</span>  Thank you, Mr President. Before putting forward suggestions to the federal government, we consulted with a whole range of people—including, importantly, emergency services, including tourism, and I think including Regional Development Australia associations in South Australia—to see what was needed by people. But, in stark contrast—in very, very stark contrast—the federal government chooses sites by some completely unknown methodology in some unknown way that seems to be based mainly on politics, given they refused to fund one single site in the Labor-held electorates in South Australia. We have no idea of any of the criteria that the federal government uses, whether it is throwing a dart at a board or purely base politics, in choosing the sites that they put up. We don't know.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />The honourable member points out, proudly, 'South Australia got 11 sites for zero investment in the first round.' The honourable member seems to be suggesting, 'Don't put money in because you're going to get sites anyway.' We put money into round 2, up to $2 million. A third of that was returned. 'We don't want your money,' the federal government said. Consequently, we see other states doing much better than South Australia. Tasmania put in $350,000 for the first round; they got 31 sites. Compare that to 20 sites this time and 11 sites the first time. We are doing only as well as Tasmania, when they put $350,000 into one single round. What we do stands in stark contrast to the Hon. Terry Stephens's federal mates.</span>

They refuse to say why some places got funded and why some places didn't get funded—absolutely no transparency whatsoever. They clearly don't go in to bat for this state. I'm not sure what the problem is—whether it is that the federal member for Barker has no influence whatsoever within the federal party room.</span>

It might be that he just lacks the influence or it might be that he can't get on with anyone, and that's why the Limestone Coast has not received a single tower under two rounds of this program.</span>

On Friday of last week, Tony Pasin, the member for Barker, told ABC radio, and I quote, 'Round 3 doesn't require a contribution from the state government.' So, in relation to the Hon.

      <span class="Normal-H">However, again, last week Tony Pasin, the member for Barker, absolutely guaranteed that Kalangadoo and Kybybolite would be funded. He guaranteed that before the last federal election; he broke that promise. He doubled down on his guarantee again last week on ABC radio, notwithstanding that the federal government's own website says that it is going to be a competitive process. Those two things cannot both be true at the same time, that he is actually guaranteeing sites in these captain's calls—the ones that the National Audit Office, the ones that the Productivity Commission has blasted—and then, at the same time, saying that there is a competitive process.</span>

On one hand we have a whole government department or Tony Pasin, the member for Barker. Someone is not getting their story completely straight or telling the truth, and I just feel sorry for the members opposite who are the poor suckers who have to wheel out the questions they are given on this topic in this chamber.</span>

We know how important it is for our environment, of course, but it is also an incredible opportunity to foster jobs and investment. A fantastic example of this will be Carbon Neutral Adelaide. I have spoken many times about how unique the Carbon Neutral Adelaide partnership is, but I want to again thank our Lord Mayor and the Adelaide City Council for being great partners with the state government.</span>

Can the minister advise how many low-flow bypass systems have been constructed in the Adelaide and Mount Lofty Ranges Natural Resources Management area and how many in the Murray-Darling NRM area? Can the minister also advise the total cost of these systems and if there were any government or taxpayer contributions to these costs and, if so, how much? Were any board members or their families recipients of taxpayer funds if they constructed low-flow bypass systems on their properties?</span>

I know that we have run a fairly innovative competition inviting people to come up with engineering solutions for low-flow bypasses. Some of them are very high tech and some are very low tech. I am not aware of any installation at this stage, but I will inquire of my agency of the total costs, if we know it, in terms of installation. Any costs to the taxpayer would go to the running of the competition, the prizes awarded, I imagine, and any other research that has been done on the matter.</span>

        <span class="GeneralBold-H">):</span>  I thank the Hon. Mr Dawkins for his question. I think the bulk of his question really speaks to a reform that has been led by the Minister for Industrial Relations, of course, who is the Deputy Premier in the other place. Parts of the Hon. Mr Dawkins' question will have to be taken on notice and passed on to him. However, there are parts that I think are more pertinent to my responsibilities, which I'm happy to respond to.</span>

I haven't received any advice or seen any correspondence to suggest that any of those workers face termination or anything along those lines, but I'm happy to double-check that and take it on notice.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />I think it is important to understand that the government's view is that this transition, or this change in management of workers compensation claims, to the best of my knowledge, is not expected to have any impact on the service delivery of injured workers, although I understand that others might have an alternative view about that, but certainly that is my understanding of the government's position.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />Regarding services that are made available to those members of SAPOL who do face concerns, such as conditions like PTSD, SAPOL provide a range of services that go beyond the ordinary entitlements that an employee would have in terms of return to work. For instance, SAPOL does have an employee assistance section, whose job it is to provide services to those employees who have had to deal with traumatic circumstances; for instance, those employees who have attended roadside crashes—something that has certainly been topical during the course of this week and today—or those SAPOL officers who had to endure and perform incredibly difficult tasks during the course of the event that unfolded throughout metropolitan Adelaide and concluded in Hindley Street early last week.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />Those are examples of circumstances that police officers may have to face which would result in them potentially gaining access to the employee assistance section that exists within SAPOL to provide mental health services and other services to those employees who may be struggling. None of that is changing. Certainly, the government takes very seriously its obligations as an employer to provide decent services to those people within the government's employ who might be subject to a workplace injury.</span>

What I can say is I am not currently aware of how any of those changes would result in a detrimental impact for those workers, nor have I received any representation from the Police Association of South Australia articulating a position that the change from self-insured status to ReturnToWorkSA having the responsibilities via their agents of managing injured workers' claims will result in a worse outcome for their employees. I haven't received any representations along those lines, and I think that bodes well for the positive impact that such a reform may have on those injured workers.</span>

It should be noted of course that the proposition is to go from a self-insured arrangement to one where the levy is paid no differently to any other non-government agency. This is simply a question of the government's self-insured status, so the costs associated with going to a registered employer arrangement would be easily recognisable in the form of the levy that is attached to every other employer in the state's wages—the return-to-work levy—but I am more than happy to take that question on notice.</span>

        <span class="GeneralBold-H">):</span>  I would like to thank the honourable member for his question. Of course, I can answer his question in some degree of detail because there is some incredibly important work that is currently being jointly undertaken between the Department for Correctional Services and also the Courts Administration Authority in and around prisoner art.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />Recently, I had the great pleasure to join Her Honour Justice Vanstone and officially open the prisoner art exhibition at the Sir Samuel Way Building. The prisoner art exhibition is a fantastic opportunity for the Department for Correctional Services, the Courts Administration Authority and prisoners alike to represent the justice sector and what they do to make a positive contribution to our community. The exhibition has more than 100 pieces of art, including paintings, sketches and drawings across the South Australian prison system.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />This is the largest exhibition of prisoner art to be gathered in South Australia to this date. The works on display across levels 1 and 3 of the Sir Samuel Way Building are largely paintings and sketches, but you might be surprised to know that a variety of media have been and are currently being practised in prisons, including ceramics, scrapbooking, mosaics, and also collage. The art of prisoners now hangs on the walls of the Sir Samuel Way Building, and I was advised that this is the first art to hang in the courts precinct since 1983, adding some much-needed colour to the walls.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />Education and recreation staff at Mobilong, Port Augusta and Mount Gambier prisons and the Cadell Training Centre conduct special art-based programs to provide constructive activities for prisoners. Prisoner art has for a long time been identified as a significant contributor to prisoner rehabilitation. This is particularly relevant when it comes to Indigenous art. Earlier this year, the Adelaide Women's Prison entered into partnership with the Women's Health Service and utilised SA Health grant funding to conduct a successful silk painting program for Aboriginal women.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />This project ran for 12 weeks as a culturally specific Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women's arts, health and wellbeing model. This provided opportunities for the women participating in the group sessions to strengthen cultural connections and enhance health and wellbeing through the use of art as a medium. It is fantastic to see some of these silk works turned into prints specifically for the exhibition now on display. Many of the women of this program commented how art was therapeutic and changed them for the better.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />Art in prisons has a number of benefits. Prisoner art helps with self-esteem, self-expression and morale and, in some cases, a possible employment option when their prison term ends. Creative expression also assists in learning; it has the potential to lower frustration levels alleviating boredom and aggression, thereby offering an avenue for correctional staff to enhance dynamic security by way of engaging with prisoners in positive ways.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />Participation in art programs whilst in prison also helps with fostering creativity, and it encourages new ways of looking at the world and new ways of expression and communication. In turn, this has positive flow-on effects to society in general and the communities in which we live. Individuals find themselves in prison for a number of reasons and usually not just one single reason—societal disadvantage, drug abuse, domestic violence. Many prisoners indeed are victims of crime themselves and I can tell you this in no uncertain terms: prisons are not enjoyable places to be.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />Deprivation of liberty is just that: a loss of some extended freedom and personal choice. Art is a way of dealing with what can be an oppressive surrounding. Art is also about dignity. It can be a way of someone saying, 'There is more to me than the crimes I have committed.' In that way, art can be restorative and the beginning of a positive exchange with the community. Exhibitions like the one on display at the Sir Samuel Way Building are a case in point.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />I would like to thank all the project team, along with representatives from each of the prisons, for all their hard work in bringing together the wonderful pieces of art on display. I extend my thanks to the Courts Administration Authority for the opportunity for Corrections to display all the wonderful art to the public. I strongly recommend that everybody who is interested in art and, indeed, those who have an interest in prisoner rehabilitation take the opportunity to look at the work.</span>

I also note that, according to the SAPOL annual report for 2015-16, as reported by <span class="-H" style="font-style:italic;">The Advertiser </span>and <span class="-H" style="font-style:italic;">Sunday Mail</span> on the weekend just gone, 5,569 drivers returned a positive drug test last financial year.

        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />Although 50,769 driver drug screening tests were conducted by police in 2015-16, this is some 2,174 fewer than in the previous financial year. In contrast to the 50,000-ish drug driving screening tests, some 544,161 drink-driving tests were conducted this last financial year—almost 10 times the number of drug driving tests conducted.

        <span class="HiddenTime-H">:33</span>
        <span class="GeneralBold-H">):</span>  I thank the honourable member for his question. As I articulated yesterday, decisions regarding the use of SAPOL's resources are entirely within the remit of the police commissioner. As a community and certainly as a parliament, we have to exercise a degree of trust that the police commissioner is using the substantial resources at his disposable in such a way as to best deliver outcomes regarding public safety. Notwithstanding that, the Hon. Mr Hood's questions are entirely reasonable, as were some of the components of the questions from the Hon. Mr Stephens yesterday.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />The answer remains the same. My advice is that SAPOL have made a very deliberate and conscious decision to try to maximise the number of defendants who are caught in the act of drug driving, and the best way to do that is to use resources in a way that is based on intelligence. My advice is that, for the last 12 months, SAPOL have been very deliberate and strategic in trying to target those people who might be associated with drug driving or those people who might be in different cohorts, or areas or times, in the community who are more likely to be performing these sorts of crimes. That is what has resulted in the spike in the number of people being detected, despite the fact that fewer tests have been taken.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />Regarding the Hon. Mr Hood's question about why there are more drink-driving tests than drug driving tests in light of the challenge we are facing, that is again a very good question. I am happy to take part of that on notice. As I acknowledged yesterday, drug driving tests are expensive. I have not received any information as to why that would be the reason there are more drink-driving tests conducted than drug driving tests, but I think we are all aware of the fact that drug driving tests are substantially more expensive. My advice is they are in the order of almost $100 a pop, in comparison to drink-driving tests, which are demonstrably cheaper. It is not an apples with apples comparison to compare drink-driving tests with drug driving tests.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />In terms of the last part of the Hon. Mr Hood's question regarding whether enforcement is part of the government's thinking when it comes to potential reforms to drug driving laws, the answer is absolutely yes. Enforcement is critical because, as the Hon. Mr Hood and others well know, there is no point in this place passing statutes if the public don't reasonably believe that they will be enforced, vis-a-vis that there isn't a reasonable proposition that if they break the law they will be caught.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />That is why the government remains absolutely committed, and consistently committed, to resourcing SAPOL with everything they need to be able to do the job. If the government receives advice from the police commissioner that he requires or desires a particular new piece of kit, or needs a piece of legislative change, that would enable him to go about the business of enforcement more effectively or efficiently, then clearly that is something the government will factor into its considerations in due course.</span>

        <span class="MemberUpper-H">The Hon. T.A. FRANKS:</span>  As the minister and no doubt many in the chamber are aware, in July 2015 an agreement was reached between the federal government and the state government to ensure a funding package to support Indigenous communities in South Australia to take up the responsibility for delivering municipal and essential services, including power, water, sewerage and rubbish collection in communities.</span>

        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />I understand that this affects at least 1,500 Aboriginal people in remote communities, according to minister Scullion's press release at the time, but I note that the minister, in his answer to a question about it being under threat, noted that it is possibly as many as 4,000 Aboriginal residents in approximately 60 locations. I ask the minister for an update on the use of that particular funding package, which I understand was a one-off. How will that funding and those services be sustained into the future, and what involvement have Indigenous communities had with the expenditure of those funds?</span>

        <span class="HiddenTime-H">:31</span>
        <span class="GeneralBold-H">):</span>  I thank the honourable member for her question. It was a difficult issue last year, right around Australia, when the federal government outlined an intention to move essential services funding out of many remote Indigenous communities. It gave rise at the time to the comment from the Premier of Western Australia that he would be closing communities down, which led to a very significant national debate that included the then prime minister talking about Aboriginal people living in remote communities as a lifestyle choice.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />It certainly was something that caused a lot of angst in Aboriginal communities around South Australia and, in the lead up to the middle of last year, was the number one topic that was raised with me when I visited remote communities. As the honourable member has outlined, after a lot of discussions and negotiations, the provision of MUNS (municipal services) in some remote Aboriginal communities was transferred from the commonwealth to the state government. These were areas outside the APY lands. The federal government still takes responsibility for all those services within the APY lands, and in some of the other communities the state government has taken over the responsibility for those services.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />The exact services vary from community to community. Some examples are: road maintenance, particularly natural water supply in catchment areas, environmental or dust control and dog control measures, but it varies from community to community. A lot of the communities in South Australia are Aboriginal Lands Trust communities. A lot of discussion and negotiation occurred last year. There was—I can't remember the exact amount—a substantial sum of money that was paid to the state government from the commonwealth for the taking over of the services in those non-APY communities. It might be that they accounted for one-third and APY accounted for two-thirds, or the other way round. I can't remember now the total municipal services expenditure in South Australia.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />After that occurred in the middle of last year, DPTI took on responsibility for the provision of those services, and by and large most of the areas that were funded have continued with DPTI providing substantially similar funding for programs that have been carried out. I am happy to go away and talk to DPTI to see if there have been any changes in the particulars of the programs. Certainly, over the course of the last 12 months, when I have travelled to Aboriginal communities, from Koonibba on the West Coast to Raukkan down near Meningie, Point Pearce and many other areas that receive municipal services funding, it is not something that has been raised with me.</span>

        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />If there's one thing I am sure of it is that if there were problems it would be raised with me, as it was in the lead-up to the federal government wanting to withdraw money from there. I will take on notice the portion of the question relating to any change in services that have been provided now that DPTI is administering those funds. The provision of those services is not something that I can recall being raised with me on a visit to a community over the last 12 months.</span>

Mr Jones was on trial for serious assault after stabbing one man and assaulting another in Blakeview last year. He was convicted, in his absence, on 19 October this year, after failing to appear in court on the last day of his trial. Whilst still being held on home detention, yesterday, Mr Jones rammed a police car, after failing to pull over to officers during a police pursuit and then ran from the scene on foot. My question to the minister is: is Mr Raymond Jones still at large? What is the update so far?</span>

        <span class="GeneralBold-H">):</span>  What a stunning question. On Tuesday 18 October, I was very pleased to join the Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources' Dog and Cat Management Board at the IAP2 Core Values Awards night. IAP2, the International Association for Public Participation, is the leading public participation association in Australasia. It aims to promote and improve the practice of public participation or community engagement decisions affecting citizens.</span>

      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />IAP2 Australasia's Core Values Awards recognise projects and organisations that are at the forefront of public participation and community engagement. They were created to encourage excellence, quality and innovation in this field. I am very pleased to have been at the awards night to see the Dog and Cat Management Board, working with democracyCo, win the Environment Award category.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />The Dog and Cat Management Board and democracyCo entered a joint submission for their stakeholder engagement and citizens' jury process around the dog and cat management reforms. This was a fantastic reflection, I think, on the state government's strong record of engaging with the community to bring their voice to the decision-making table. I would like to encourage anyone interested to read the state government's Better Together: Principles of Engagement document. It is a great foundation for engagement with a focus on community consultation. When we involve people in conversations about decisions that affect them, we can get better outcomes for entire communities.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />We can remember when those opposite, I suppose, announced that they wanted to deregulate shop trading hours, for example, without even bothering to consult major employers or employees. It would be nice if on the rare occasion that they release a policy, they actually bother to speak to people that that policy impacts. One gets the feeling, of course, that the Leader of the Opposition will say and do anything to try and cling on to his job. Anyway, while they bicker between themselves, we are getting on with governing for all South Australians. Changes to the dog and cat law reforms are a great example of this.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />Our dog and cat reforms are the most sweeping changes made to the state's animal welfare laws for more than 20 years. They will help to bring an end to puppy farms, giving South Australians the confidence they need to know that their dog or cat comes from a reputable breeder. This is a great outcome for all dog and cat lovers in South Australia of course. It will now be compulsory for dog and cat owners to microchip and desexed their dogs and cats.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />I would like to again commend the community engagement work undertaken by the Dog and Cat Management Board and democracyCo and congratulate them on their award. I would also like to take the opportunity to congratulate the Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources, who were highly commended in the organisation of the year category.</span>

        <span class="GeneralBold-H">):</span>  I rise to speak about arts and music education. As members are aware, there have been a number of cuts and threats made to the arts industry and to arts and music education, both at a state and federal level in recent months. Funding has been sliced and diced at state and federal levels with even our flagship arts festival, the Adelaide Festival, taking a hit. What I find even more concerning is the seemingly blasé attitude towards arts education for our young people when it is so vital.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />Recently, federal Minister for Education and Training, Simon Birmingham, called arts education at a VET level a 'lifestyle choice'. That was his justification why VET student loans have been cut for courses such as communications, visual arts, editing, animation and jewellery design. It prefaced an announcement that almost 60 arts diplomas would no longer be eligible for these student loans and the priority would be elsewhere.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />Now we learn that at a state level the Department for Education and Child Development schools in our public education system run the risk of losing the ability for their students to undertake education in musical instruments due to a current standoff that is going through the industrial relations system. With the potential loss next year of the offerings of instrumental music teachers to public school students, many young people may well miss out on an opportunity to become a musician or simply to broaden their education.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />Mr Birmingham, at the federal level, projected his belief upon people that somehow the arts are not a career, and we are seeing it again at a state level with our state education system devaluing creative skills and the potential loss of dedicated musical professionals and aspiring young musicians. Cuts to creativity mean children may never realise their dream or their potential. They may well go on to find a real job as a musician, an actor, a visual artist, a cartoonist, a game developer or a dancer.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />By pigeonholing young people and steering their educational offerings away from arts, we not only lead them to a life lacking in passion but we also deny them their true genius. The world would benefit from more diversity in arts and music education right from the start. South Australia should be ensuring that public school students have the opportunity to take up the broadest range of offerings, including musical education.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />There is an allegory, 'Everybody is a genius, but if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.' There are many young people in our schools who may struggle with maths and who may find it difficult within other areas of the curriculum, but who may shine at music. For them, that offering is the difference between a school experience that is reflective and supportive of their genius or one that treats them as lacking in that genius and somehow stupid.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />If we cease to offer our students in South Australia a range of opportunities to find their passion or their genius, they may well spend their whole life thinking that they are not able to shine. We should value all facets of education, including the arts, arithmetic and agricultural studies. Everybody excels at something, but if the 'somethings' keep being cut then many people will not find that thing they excel at, and we as a society will be the losers as a result.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />What if the next Jimi Hendrix loses his guitar tutor, the next Matt Groening cannot access a student loan for his drawing course or the next Billie Holiday is not allocated a voice teacher? I do not want to see the next generation of children who may well be fish trying to climb trees when they could be happy and talented swimmers. With that, the Greens will be supporting the campaign to keep music education in public schools.</span>

        <span class="GeneralBold-H">):</span>  I rise to speak about a World AIDS Day 2016 event organised by PEACE Multicultural Services, a service provided by Relationships Australia SA. World AIDS Day falls on 1 December each year. I was pleased to lend my support to officially launch this year's HIV testing campaign, which a team of staff and volunteers worked extremely hard to create. The slogan of this year's campaign is: 'Together we can make a positive change: get tested, get treated, live longer'. This campaign serves as an important reminder that it is our individual and collective responsibility to examine and understand the range of resources that are available to us.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />The annual World AIDS Day event is celebrated globally to raise awareness about the various issues surrounding HIV/AIDS. It is also a day for people to show their support for people affected by HIV and to commemorate the many lives that have been lost as a result of HIV/AIDS. Despite the advances and achievements made so far, we need to continue generating awareness about the issues still facing us today.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />The goals of the National HIV Strategy 2014-17 in Australia are to work towards achieving the virtual elimination of HIV transmission in Australia by 2020, reduce the morbidity and mortality caused by HIV and minimise the personal and social impact of HIV. I am pleased that the government of South Australia is committed to achieving these goals through the various strategies identified in the South Australian HIV Implementation Plan. I commend the various committees and working groups, which PEACE Multicultural Services is part of, which have been set up to implement these strategies.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />I am proud that the state government is also committed to commencing the HIV prevention drug pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) trial in this state. This trial is expected to reduce the risk of HIV infection for about 500 South Australians. I note that early diagnosis and commencement of treatment remain crucial for these targets to be achieved. It is heartening to know that we have reached a point where an HIV diagnosis is no longer a death sentence. These days, it is a condition that can be managed with available medication and support.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />Sadly, I can remember a time when this was not the case. In the 1980s, when HIV was first discovered, I vividly remember the grim reaper ads that were shown on television at that time. There were a lot of misconceptions about the transmission of HIV and, unfortunately, misconceptions still exist within the community to this day.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />This is why it is important to recognise that the stigma and discrimination associated with HIV continue to prevent people from getting tested. Any person affected by HIV has the right to live and participate in a community free from discrimination. We all have a role to play in creating this safe space by uniting and speaking openly, with the collective goal of challenging misconceptions and discrimination. A unique aspect of human nature is that we may tend to think that we are invincible and that nothing will happen to us—until it is too late. I encourage all members of the community to get tested, to know their status and to seek available treatment if necessary.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />As we work together towards the elimination of HIV transmission, let us spread the message that HIV is not something to be feared and keep the conversation going throughout the community. If you are in a high-risk group, the message is: get tested, get treated, live longer. In closing, I commend PEACE Multicultural Services for their unrelenting efforts and dedication to working with diverse communities and to providing education and support for people living with HIV and their families.</span>

        <span class="GeneralBold-H">):</span>  On the final parliamentary sitting week for this year, it is my pleasure to rise and speak in the South Australian parliament today about the launch of the Australia-China Joint Economic Report. As the shadow parliamentary secretary for trade and investment and multicultural affairs, I was honoured to be invited by the University of Adelaide and the Institute for International Trade to be one of the guest speakers at the breakfast forum for the launch of the Australia-China Joint Economic Report on Friday 18 November 2016.</span>

        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />This important report is the result of a significant and unprecedented joint economic study by two countries. I would like to pay tribute to the outstanding work of the co-editors and engineers of the comprehensive report, namely, Professor Peter Drysdale and Zhang Xiaoqiang. The study was undertaken by the East Asian Bureau of Economic Research in the Crawford School of Public Policy at the Australian National University, together with the China Centre for International Economic Exchanges in Beijing.</span>

      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />I had the pleasure of speaking to Professor Peter Drysdale before the breakfast forum and, of course, meeting him at the launch. Peter is the Emeritus Professor of Economics and the head of the East Asian Bureau of Economic Research and East Asia Forum at the Crawford School of Public Policy at the Australian National University. He is a delightful and energetic professor, with an abundance of knowledge about China and the region, and widely recognised as the leading intellectual architect of APEC. Peter is one of those people with whom you can have a meaningful debate and conversation on any given day.</span>

      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />As honourable members know, Australia and China, two vastly different nations, already have a strong joint political, economic and social investment in the success of a bilateral relationship. As China's economy matures and its middle class expands with free trade agreements put in place, China is enjoying greater access to Australian agriculture, institutions and services—everything from infant formula to vitamins, butter to beef, education to tourism, as well as advanced science, technology and research capabilities. We certainly hope to see many more Australian products and brands becoming household names in China.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />Both Australia and China gain enormous benefit from growing and diversifying their economic relationship through new flows of tourists, students, investors and migrants. The new report plays an important role in consolidating all the facts and data in establishing some common reference points. This is a vital opportunity for both countries to think about how to shape the future course of our long-term partnership in a deliberate and strategic way.</span>

Thanks also to the Institute of International Trade staff, Lisa Hunt and Amy Johns, for coordinating the launch. Special thanks to Professor Christopher Findlay, Executive Dean of the Faculty of Professions, for doing a fantastic job as the emcee and moderator for the robust panel discussion.</span>

I had the pleasure to join the panel discussion with Mr Sean Keenihan and Mr Alfonzo (Alf) Ianniello. It was great to see both of them sharing their insights and engagement with China.</span>
    </p>

Alf is the CEO of the Detmold Group, a well-established global manufacturing business in paper packaging products in Australia, Asia and South Africa. The company employs 2,500 people and distributes its products in 22 cities around the world.</span>

      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />The panel members recognised that China has been the world's main economic growth engine and agreed that it is timely to have a comprehensive report that defines a new framework that will unlock more potential and enable South Australia to harness opportunities that arise from the profound transformations in both economies. I encourage honourable members to read the report in their spare time, perhaps over the Christmas break. In closing, I thank everyone for their contributions this year, and I convey my best wishes to honourable members and staff for a merry Christmas and a happy new year.</span>

    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />This survey was a national survey and, while the national results have highlighted a lot of areas for discussion, the South Australian results are of particular interest. The survey received 21,846 responses from young people aged 15 to 19, and 2,358 young South Australians participated in the survey. Overall, the results of this survey highlight the key concerns of young Australians and some of the findings are deeply saddening.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />Our young people reported a high level of experience with discrimination. In South Australia, nearly half of young women reported having experienced unfair treatment or discrimination based on their gender in the past 12 months. Furthermore, more than 26 per cent of respondents had experienced discrimination due to their race or cultural background. Overall, one in four young people had experienced unfair treatment or discrimination in the past year, and one in two young people had witnessed someone being treated unfairly due to their race, sexuality or physical ability. It is not surprising then that nearly 30 per cent identified equity and discrimination as the most important issues facing our country.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />When asked about how discrimination could be combatted, those surveyed suggested that political leaders could be better advocates for equality. In the Greens, we are proud to have equality as a core value of our party. The passing of the Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration (Gender Identity) Amendment Bill and the Relationships Register (No 1) Bill yesterday was an encouraging step forwards in the march towards equality. However, there is still a lot of work to do. We are passing more bills today, but as South Australia still has the gay panic defence, we must not rest on our laurels.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />What I think we really need to recognise as a result of this survey is that young South Australians were the least positive about the future out of all the young people in the country. Just over 11 per cent of young South Australians were either negative or very negative about their future, which is higher than the national average, and a further 27.7 per cent were neutral.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />Young people also differed from the rest of the country in their choice of the top three issues of concern. In South Australia, young people identified the same issues as their counterparts interstate, namely equality and discrimination as number one, and mental health as number two. However, at number three, population issues were the next issue of concern for young South Australians. This is probably reflecting a concern about the number of young people leaving our state. As the local economy struggles, more young people leave and they take with them their knowledge, expertise and new ideas.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />The Mission Australia survey showed that in South Australia 17.7 per cent of young people were most concerned about jobs as compared with 9.9 per cent nationally. Young people are feeling stressed about their capacity and opportunities to meet their aspirations. It is not really surprising that young people are feeling this way when our general and youth unemployment rates are so high in South Australia, when our government is slow to act on solutions and our parliament struggles with legislation that would improve equality and mental health.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />We also need to invest in the industries of the future such as renewable energy, which we know is a jobs-rich industry, far more than fracking for gas. I think it is important that this parliament hears and acknowledges the very real concerns of our young people but, beyond that, we need to act on those concerns. Often we hear older South Australians disparaging young people, saying they are apathetic, uninformed and uninvolved in politics. Of course, we know this is just not true. I want young people in our state to know that they are heard and that we recognise their struggles and concerns. We know that they are passionate and intelligent citizens with much to contribute to our state, both now and in the future.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />As parliamentarians, we represent all our constituents, both young and older. We need to work harder to secure the futures and hopes of all South Australians, but particularly young South Australians. As Kofi Annan, former secretary-general of the United Nations, once said:</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

          <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />Normally, when we need to know about something, we go to the experts, but we tend to forget that when we want to know about youths and what they feel and what they want, </span>
        <span class="-H" style="&#xA;    font-size:8.5pt;&#xA;  ">that </span>
        <span class="-H" style="&#xA;    font-size:8.5pt;&#xA;  ">we should talk to them.</span>
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">It is quite clear to me that the youth of Australia have told us plainly what they are feeling and what their concerns are, and as parliamentarians it is our job to listen. It is also vital that we as a parliament continue to create opportunities for young people to find meaningful employment and to invest in the industries of the future so that the talent, skills and knowledge of our young people can remain in this state.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />We need to fight for better and more mental health services and to actually fund those services properly, but what is equally important is that we enable young people to see themselves as part of the decision-making process in this state and that they know that we hear the feedback they are giving us and that we are taking it seriously.</span>

        <span class="HiddenTime-H">:20</span>
        <span class="GeneralBold-H">):</span>  I want to talk about a minister who has been caught out not telling the truth, a minister who has engaged in a deliberate strategy by him and his officers to conceal the total cost of his many overseas trips over the last two years, and a minister, in minister Hamilton-Smith, who is clearly embarrassed that, should the total costs (which potentially run into some hundreds of thousands of dollars) be publicised prior to the next election, it will be a source of much embarrassment to him.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />The member for Schubert has highlighted that in 2016 the minister has had 114 days of gazetted leave and in 2015 he had 110 days of gazetted leave, some of which of course was personal leave and much of which was gazetted leave for travel overseas. The minister is required, as all ministers are, to proactively disclose travel and travel costs. On the state development department website, a consolidated travel report for the minister and his staffers for July to November 2015 lists only one trip for July, at a cost of $4,699. However, the member for Schubert has established under FOI that there have been a further seven overseas trips which have not been revealed, and no costs have been revealed for the cost of those trips in that six-month period. It also omitted the details of the trip to China in July 2015.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />Similarly, in 2016 there has been significant non-disclosure of overseas travel on the minister's website. When one looks at some of these trips—in August of 2015 there was travel to Turkey, India, South-East Asia, the United States of America and Europe over a period of more than a month—there is no disclosure at all of that particular trip, yet there are press releases and other information from freedom of information that clearly indicate that the minister was overseas during that period, yet refused to declare the details of that trip and the cost.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />Similarly, there was a trip in November to Indonesia and India. Again, there is no disclosure of that trip, even though there is information available to indicate that the minister had taken that trip. There are a number of trips during that period where clearly the minister, through his own website, has released information from overseas but has refused to disclose the details of that trip and that particular travel. This is clearly a grotesque abuse by the minister of the rules, which require public accountability for the spending of taxpayers' money.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />Sadly, it appears to be typical of the arrogance of a man who is full of his own self-importance and obviously believes that the rules that apply to everyone else do not apply to him. He has obviously embarked on a conscious policy of refusing to disclose. I understand that, when quizzed by either journalists or members of parliament, he embarks on an aggressive or intimidatory response, trying to close down any genuine questions about the particular issues, refusing to answer questions when clearly he issues press releases from overseas, indicating he is travelling overseas, he is on gazetted leave, yet he lodges disclosure documents which indicate that he has not travelled at all during that period.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />A wise person once told me, 'If you're not going to tell the truth, you had better have a good memory because you need to remember all the untruths you have been telling over a long period of time.' Clearly, the minister has been caught out in relation to this. He issues press releases, but then, when it comes to disclose, refuses to disclose. When pressed by the media, his office, on his authorisation, points the finger at the department and says, 'Well, we're not really sure why it hasn't gone up. That's the department's fault.'</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />It is his responsibility, as minister, to be publicly accountable for the expenditure of his money. He obviously hopes that with bluff, bluster, intimidation and aggressive behaviour he will drive away anyone who might want to ask questions about these issues. It is the typical attitude of the schoolyard bully, someone who thinks that he can get away with it and that the rules do not apply to him.</span>

        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />Mr President, I assure you that in the interests of public accountability the member for Schubert will continue to pursue the minister through freedom of information requests. We will do our part, through the Budget and Finance Committee, to tally the total costs of all the trips the minister has been taking and refusing to be held accountable for. We will make sure that the public is aware of the total cost of the minister's travels over the two-year period leading up to the election in March 2018.</span>

This includes an online resource page to support the 68 member councils, paving the way for a consistent and easy-to-understand approach to developing their own strategies—a most important collaboration—so that we afford some protection and certainty for the music industry going forward, given the pressure that live music venues are under from developers in the city entertainment district (CED).</span>

The MIC was established to be a unified voice for the South Australian music industry focusing on the issues, opportunities and development of South Australian music with stakeholders and government bodies. The South Australian music industry has already begun reaping the benefits of the MIC, with changes to entertainment consent rules, variations to the National Construction Code and the establishment of the Live Music Regulation Roundtable.

This highly successful program included 221 music events, 662 individual performances, 45 free music events and 138 venues. This addition of music to the 2016 Fringe was a standout and testament to the MDO and all those involved in creating, expanding and committing important resources to the future of music in South Australia.</span>

        <span class="HiddenTime-H">:12</span>
        <span class="GeneralBold-H">):</span>  I rise today to speak about the increase in the use of illicit drugs in our community. According to the 2015-16 SAPOL annual report, illicit drug offences are again on the rise. According to the statistics contained in the report and elsewhere, illicit drug offences have increased by some 24.2 per cent, or 768 offences, over the period. According to SAPOL, one of the main reasons for this can be attributed to the 72.8 per cent, or 437 offences, increase in offences relating to possession and use of drugs. In the category of 'other drug offences', which includes the possession, use, sale or furnishing of any drug or intoxicating substance or drug paraphernalia prohibited by law, there was an increase of 51.1 per cent, or 324 offences—a very substantial increase.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />In addition to this, the number of general expiations issued by police has increased by 9.8 per cent, or 2,867 offences. When you consider that 2,867 offences represents only 9.8 per cent, it indicates that the number of offences is in the order of 22,000 per year. Again, the increase correlates to illicit drug use. SAPOL has stated that the rise in expiation notices is a result of a 28.9 per cent, or 1,615, increase in drug diversions. Based on this sharp increase in drug diversions, police are evidently placing more emphasis on the educational aspect of engaging with adult offenders using diversionary options.</span>

For a child aged 10 to 17 years, this includes all illicit substances. For adults, possession of cannabis would not qualify a person to be diverted; however, a cannabis expiation notice would apply. Cannabis expiation notices have also increased by 6.6 per cent, with 601 more issued than in the previous year.</span>

Drug and Alcohol Services SA is responsible for the statewide coordination of the PDDI program, and supporting clinicians and health workers also help to administer the program.</span>

        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />The service provides a health-based assessment and provides for drug screening and brief intervention sessions of up to two sessions or ongoing treatment of up to eight intervention sessions, depending on the needs of the individual who has been diverted. Although this initiative has had a positive impact, unfortunately there is still a considerable number of those within the community who, to their own detriment, and to the detriment of the whole community in some cases, are ignoring the harm caused by illicit drugs.</span>

      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />These prohibited substances have caused and continue to cause considerable harm on our roads and in people's lives more generally. According to the SAPOL annual report for 2015-16, as recently reported by the <span class="-H" style="font-style:italic;">Sunday Mail</span> on the weekend, and as I mentioned in my question in the council today, some 5,569 drivers returned a positive drug test last financial year. In contrast, there were only 1,832 in 2010-11, so that is almost a threefold increase.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />Surprisingly, 50,769 drug driver screening tests were conducted by police in 2015-16, which is actually 2,174 fewer than last financial year. In contrast to the just over 50,000 drug driver tests, there were over half a million (544,161) drink-driving tests conducted in the same financial year, almost 10 times the amount of the drug driving tests conducted. There have been calls for increased roadside drug screening tests, which is supported by the substantial increase of drug drivers on our roads.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />Based on all the statistics I have quoted and the many others contained in the SAPOL Annual Report and other criminal offending reports, there needs to be one constant theme and that is that the use of illicit drugs is continually on the rise and the government must act. As the Minister for Police has said in this place, there is no silver bullet; however, reforming drug penalties and drug sentencing would go a long way to addressing this issue.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />At the moment, drug penalties and drug sentencing are not adequate or in line with community standards. This is reflected by a very recent <span class="-H" style="font-style:italic;">Sunday Mail</span> poll, which I think my colleague the Hon. Mark Parnell might have referred to in his contribution, although he was referring to a different part of it of course, which found that some 61.7 per cent of respondents felt judges were 'out of touch with community values' and, moreover, that 74.2 per cent believed that penalties were 'too lenient'. Given all the statistics and strong views held by the community, the government needs to respond to this issue sooner rather than later as, clearly, it is getting out of hand.</span>

      <span class="Normal-H">I am sure members will recall that, over recent years in periods leading up to state elections and by‑elections, this state government has been quite happy to spend millions of dollars of taxpayer money as it sees fit to further its own party political interests at particular times. We have seen, on a rough count, more than $4 million being spent on various advertising campaigns over those last few years: $1.1 million on an anti-federal government pensioner concessions campaign, $1.1 million on a Federal Cuts Hurt campaign, $1.2 million on a More Than Cars campaign, and $500,000 on the submarine procurement issue. I am sure that does not include all the taxpayer-funded political campaigns that the government has engaged upon.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />The first thing I would say in relation to these issues is that it is entirely the prerogative of the state government of the day to campaign against decisions a federal government takes which it believes are not in the public interest of the people of South Australia, and it has considerable resources, without resorting to taxpayer-funded advertising campaigns, with which it can do that. It has an army of spin doctors and other staff. It obviously has the resources of their own taxpayer-funded ministers and almost unlimited access to free media in South Australia to prosecute their case on talkback radio, television news, radio news, digital media, etc., that a decision that the federal government might have taken, in their view, might not be in the public interest.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />The state Liberal Party, under the strong leadership of Steven Marshall, the member for Dunstan, has, on a number of occasions, expressed our strongly differing views on some decisions that have been taken by the federal government which we believe were not in the best interests of the people of South Australia.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />For example, in the period leading up to 2014 we opposed the range of cuts that were made in the health portfolio during that period, and said so publicly and on any number of occasions. In relation to the submarine issue, on occasions when it appeared that there was the possibility that a decision unfavourable to South Australia might have eventuated, Steven Marshall and the state Liberal Party expressed a fiercely partisan South Australian view in terms of supporting both shipbuilding and submarine building in South Australia.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />There is nothing wrong with a government or a political party in South Australia fiercely arguing in a partisan way for what it believes to be in the public interest for the people of South Australia. However, where the line should be drawn and has not been drawn is where Premier Weatherill in particular and the state Labor government generally have been more than prepared to engage in large-scale taxpayer-funded advertising campaigns, and I will refer to one of those later on, which in some cases are clearly misleading and dishonest in terms of their content.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />It has not just been in that area; there have been other criticisms that have been raised publicly at the Budget and Finance Committee, where again, contrary to the government's own guidelines, we have seen either premier Rann or Premier Weatherill breaching those guidelines by the circulation of documents, such as, in the period leading up to the last state election, the Riverbank experience document. A glossy, full colour Adelaide Oval document was circulated in some marginal seats, which included full colour photographs of the Premier of the day arguing all the good things they believed were being done by the state Labor government for the people of South Australia.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />There have also been other abuses. In the Public Sector (Data Sharing) Bill I referred to one particular outrageous example of an abuse of a public sector database, where, in the period leading up to the last state election, the Labor Party and the government circulated a copy of the Labor Party policy, approved and endorsed by the state secretary of the Labor Party, no less, to all members on the education department database. It did not even pretend to be a Weatherill government document. It was approved and endorsed by the state secretary of the Labor Party.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />A copy of the education policy of the Labor Party was circulated to all teachers and SSOs and others within the education sector database. I expressed some concerns, in the Public Sector (Data Sharing) Bill, about the potential for an amalgamation of these sorts of databases to allow a captive market for a premier of the day who was quite prepared to abuse access to those databases with party political material.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />I want to refer now to an even more outrageous example from only the last few days, an email from Premier Jay Weatherill, dated 1 December, so last Thursday, to, I think, all staff in the public sector. It was not just an email received by a section of the Department of the Premier and Cabinet. This email is entitled 'An economy in transition'. It is offensive enough in one respect, but we have seen a number of these before, where the Premier of the state argues to their public servants, who are a captive market because they are on the database of the government, about all the wonderful things, according to the government, they have done: how many new jobs they have created, how employment is growing, the biggest mines, tourism is growing. It is a political spin, as best as the government can make it, about how well the state is doing and about how well the government is doing.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />What is even more offensive in relation to this particular government advertising program, this email from the Premier to staff, is that he launches a full frontal attack on Steven Marshall and the Liberal Party in an email from the Premier of the state to all public servants in the public sector. It starts with:</span>

        <span class="-H" style="&#xA;    font-size:8.5pt;&#xA;  ">espite this, Steven Marshall and the Liberals have spent much of the year opposed to just about everything. He claimed to support investigating increasing our participation in the nuclear fuel cycle, but</span>

    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">Again, this is dishonest because the Premier tells all the public servants that it was a moratorium on fracking in the whole of the state when clearly it was limited to the South-East of South Australia. He goes on:</span>

      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">again, an outright lie; that was never the position of Steven Marshall and the Liberals—</span>

        <span class="-H" style="&#xA;    font-size:8.5pt;&#xA;  ">but then called for us to bring them forward. Put simply, Steven Marshall has offered no real plans or real leadership in 2016. His policy document 2036 is evidence of that.</span>
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">It is just appalling that we could have a Premier of the state and a government that feels so immune to criticism and so arrogant as to say, 'We really don't care. We are going to use every device, every facility, every mechanism and every media outlet we have at our disposal to smash the hell out of Steven Marshall and the Liberal Party and to portray ourselves in the best possible light.'</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />I have been in this chamber, in government or in opposition, for many years. I do not think I can ever recall such a blatantly political public sector email from the Premier of the state bagging the opposing leader and political party. That is what we the opposition or minor parties and Independents are up against when we are considering what this government, what this Premier, is prepared to do using taxpayer funds in their own interests.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />I want to turn to the most outrageous example in terms of paid advertising, which was the Federal Cuts Hurt campaign. I am going to seek leave to conclude my remarks in February, but what has been revealed in relation to this is appalling, and I suspect there is more to come in relation to this particular campaign.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />What it indicates is a premier in Premier Weatherill and a government that are willing to do and say almost anything in its own partisan political interests. It is in my view the worst example of abuse of the government's own guidelines that we have seen thus far. I think, when all the details of the Federal Cuts Hurt campaign hopefully, at some stage, see the light of day prior to March 2018, all people will be horrified at the extent to which the Premier and his supporters are prepared to go in terms of their own partisan political interests.</span>

      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />I remind members of the report that was written, after questions had been raised about this campaign, by the Auditor-General in November 2015, titled Government Marketing Communications Report. This was the independent Auditor-General. If I have any criticism of this Auditor-General and others it certainly will not be strong, but I think they could and should go harder in relation to the criticisms of some of the outrages and abuses that they uncover in their reports. Nevertheless, this is the audit conclusion on page 2 where the Auditor-General says:</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">

        <span class="-H" style="&#xA;    font-size:8.5pt;&#xA;  ">
          <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />We did find that the Federal Cuts Hurt campaign, the most controversial campaign we reviewed, and which cost $1.18 million, was inherently for a political purpose as it pertained to the State, its government and policy. We did not find it was for a party political purpose. It was this campaign in particular that highlighted weaknesses in existing guidelines.</span>
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">I respectfully strenuously disagree with the Auditor-General's conclusion that he did not find it was for a party political purpose, and I will outline that in a moment. At the very least, he concluded that it was the 'most controversial campaign' and was 'inherently for a political purpose as it pertained to the state, its government and policy'. On pages 3 and 4, the Auditor-General's summary of audit findings on this Federal Cuts Hurt campaign said:</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">

          <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />…following a change to the originally planned second phase of the campaign, it was not evident how the campaign met its original objectives to engage with the community on solutions and decision-making</span>
        <span class="-H" style="&#xA;    font-size:8.5pt;&#xA;  ">…</span>
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">The report shows that there had been—and I forget the correct advertising phrase—an explanation of the purpose of the campaign, which was originally given to the committee. The Auditor-General is highlighting that the end was changed in terms of the purpose, and he is reporting that he did not believe the campaign met its original objectives to engage with the community on solutions and decision-making. Clearly, that was just a ruse to supposedly get it through the guidelines, if that was the purpose of the campaign.</span>

        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />The purpose of the campaign was to belt hell out of our federal Liberal government. The purpose of the campaign was to try to set up a battle between a state Labor premier who wanted to portray himself as a fearless warrior and advocate on behalf of South Australia, taking on the terrible monster of the federal Liberal government and, by association, to also attack the state Liberal Party because part of their campaign was to try to link Steven Marshall and the state Liberals with the federal Liberals during that particular campaign period.</span>

        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />As I said, I strenuously disagree with the Auditor-General's understanding and final assessment that it was not party political. It had to be party political, and it was the only reason why the state government engaged in. As the Auditor-General said in his own findings, 'I couldn't see how it was actually meeting the original objective which was to engage with the community on solutions and decision-making.' Anyone who can recall those advertisements would know that there was no engagement with the community about solutions and decision-making. It was finger-pointing; it was blame directed towards a political party, which happened to be the same political party as his political opponents in South Australia at that particular time. On page 4 of his audit finding, the Auditor‑General said:</span>

      <span class="Normal-H">All that says is: it did not say 'Jay Weatherill', neither did it say 'Labor Party' nor 'Liberal Party'. It just referred to the Premier and the state government against the federal government. But everyone knows, without the use of the words 'Labor' and 'Liberal', that the federal government was a Liberal one and the state government was a Labor one, and the state Labor government was opposing a Liberal Party, which, by association, clearly was in the same party as the federal Liberal government at the time. Finally, the Auditor-General in his report states:</span>

      <span class="Normal-H">Once again, there are no surprises there. The Auditor-General says, 'Look, I've looked at this commercial. The use of emotive language is inconsistent with the objectivity criteria'—that is, you have to maintain high standards—'and it reasonably contributes to the perception that it has a political motivation rather than providing information'.</span>

        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />The Auditor-General found that it contributed to the perception that it has political motivation yet in his audit conclusion says, 'Whilst it was inherently for a political purpose, we did not find it was for a party political purpose.' I think that is sophistry in its extreme, but putting that aside, my criticism is not directed at the Auditor-General; it is directed at the Premier, the Weatherill Labor government and all its fellow travellers.</span>

      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />In concluding my remarks this afternoon—as I said, I will seek leave to conclude my remarks in February—these abuses by Premier Weatherill and the Weatherill Labor government can only occur if the government implants in the appropriate sections of its department key people in key positions. Mr Acting President, you and other members will have often heard me talk about the Labor government parachuting their fellow travellers, former ministerial staffers, Labor Party contacts and Labor Party supporters into key positions in the public sector. I do not do that just as a passing interest; there is a deliberate intent and purpose in many of these appointments.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />When you look at how campaigns like this get up and going, you need key people in departments like the Department of the Premier and Cabinet. At that time, the Weatherill government had managed to get some key people into key positions. Mr Paul Flanagan and Mr Rik Morris, former key staffers under Labor governments over many years, under both premier Rann and Premier Weatherill, held key positions in the communications advisory section of the Department of the Premier and Cabinet.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />There is a committee, PCAG, that looks after the advertising guidelines for advertising campaigns. At varying stages, both Mr Flanagan and Mr Morris had influence as key people within the Department of the Premier and Cabinet but, in terms of communication strategy overall, they had responsibility. Over the last 12 months or however long it has been, another former Labor Party staffer, Mr Kym Winter-Dewhirst has been parachuted into the Department of the Premier and Cabinet. At varying stages, you have had Mr Flanagan and Mr Morris and now you have Mr Winter-Dewhirst. Mr Flanagan has gone, but another government staffer from another ministerial office has been parachuted into the Department of the Premier and Cabinet.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />Why is that important? It is important because you need people in the public sector in key positions who have the same willingness as the Premier of the State of South Australia to use public funds to further the interests of the Weatherill Labor government in South Australia. In and of itself, it is not sufficient for the Premier to say, 'I want to spend $1 million plus on a Federal Cuts Hurt campaign.' He needs key people in key positions in his department to help implement that particular program and policy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />That is why some of these decisions, in terms of having people like Mr Flanagan, Mr Morris and others—and now Mr Winter-Dewhirst—in these key positions is important. As has been demonstrated, in terms of the breaches of the advertising guidelines which the Auditor-General has found and which we have highlighted on any number of occasions in relation to some of these campaigns, the Premier and the government, with the complicity, support or active action in some cases of some of these Labor Party staffers in key positions, have been prepared to bend where it is required and break where it is required the rules of engagement, the accepted rules of public accountability, the accepted rules of how taxpayers' money should be spent and how it should be accounted for.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />We have seen perfect examples of this with this outrageous abuse of the Federal Cuts Hurt campaign that has been highlighted not just by the Auditor-General but by other information that has come to light and that will come to light. When you have a situation where Premier Weatherill and the government say to key people, 'Jump,' some of these people are prepared to say, 'How high?' Their loyalty to the cause, and their loyalty to the re-election of the Weatherill Labor government, knows no bounds.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />My criticism is almost solely directed at the Premier and the key ministers who drive this process, but in the end, if there are senior public servants as former Labor Party staffers who have been complicit in implementing some of these policies and guidelines, they too must accept their share of criticism. With that, I seek leave to conclude my remarks.</span>

        <span class="MemberUpper-H">The Hon. J.M.A. LENSINK:</span>  I have been listening intently to the debate both this morning and yesterday afternoon. I am pleased that the amendments to the amendment have been made; that is, the Hon. Tammy Franks has amended the amendment of the Hon. Dennis Hood and there has been some narrowing. I must admit that I had that same question mark when I looked at some of the conditions, and I was not sure what the intent was. I think there has been some additional transparency for clients that might not have been there before.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />I do hold concerns about inconsistency between the federal legislation and the state legislation in terms of the Sex Discrimination Act and our state Equal Opportunity Act. I do not actually accept that these amendments are comparable to medical terminations because that conscientious objection is usually based on medical practitioners objecting to the procedure and administering it, whereas in these amendments it is an objection to providing a service to a particular client group.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />In practice, as someone who has undergone these procedures, it is difficult to see how most of the staff who are involved—nurses, anaesthetists, lab technicians and other medical practitioners—would be aware of the personal circumstances of the client or the patient, apart from the actual doctor under whose care and with whom the client's patients are associated and who takes the personal history and so forth. So, for a range of reasons I am unable to support this set of amendments.</span>

        <span class="MemberUpper-H">The Hon. K.L. VINCENT:</span>  I am certainly more inclined toward the Franks version of the amendment, and I thank the Hon. Ms Franks for moving it. My personal initial preference would be to pass neither amendment, and I think minister Hunter did a rather good job of explaining why before we rose for the lunch break. I am going to try to elaborate on some of the points why I think it is wrong to allow anyone to use their religious beliefs to not provide a service to a particular group.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />The Hon. Ms Lensink has made a good point: this is not about whether or not they agree with the actual procedure or service holus-bolus; this is about denying it to a particular group. I will try to explain as eloquently as I can why I disagree with that. I try to refrain from telling personal stories in this chamber because, as much as the Hon. Mr Wade might think otherwise, it is not actually all about me; however, there comes a time every now and again when I think they are useful. I have a couple of stories, and I will start with one and then come back to another.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />Should I ever have the privilege to have my own family—and it is important that we remember, as Mr Wade has reminded us, that that is not necessarily a right per se but a privilege—I would strongly prefer to do that via adoption rather than by carrying my own children. This is for a number of reasons, but mostly because I see it as: why would I have a baby born into not royalty but relative privilege when I can help a child who already exists? As a friend once put to me, 'You can hang a painting in your house and still love it without having to make the painting yourself.' However, I still support this bill because I understand that this is a very personal and nuanced issue, and it is not for me to stop others from building a family in a different way should they choose to, even though that might not be what I would choose to do.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />I want to add at this point that I do support freedom of belief, including religion, in one's private life. I do not have any issue with that. I do not believe that this should extend to the provision of non-religious specific services. Indeed, I think this is backed up by the letter that we have received from such a service provider as Repromed, telling us that they would be quite happy to continue providing services to people seeking ART, regardless of marital status or family structure.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />If I book an airfare, if I book a ticket on a flight, no-one at Jetstar or Qantas has the right to ask me why I am booking that flight, even though they might vehemently disagree with the reason I am going on that trip. If I order a cup of coffee at a cafe, no-one asks me if I am buying that coffee in the context of going on a date with a woman. So, I do not see why this sort of judgement should extend to ART services.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />The last point I want to make is that I have given this some thought over the break and I have come to the conclusion that even if a registered objector has to refer the client, whom they do not wish to service, to another clinician who may service them, I still think this could cause significant anguish and pain. In thinking about this I was reminded of a similar, but different, experience of my own in which I was having a conversation with my disability support worker at the time—I think she was helping with housework or shopping or something and we got into a conversation, as you do in these situations. Somehow the topic of having children came up. She asked me whether I would like to have my own children. When I responded yes, she looked at me with a look of real shock on her face and said, 'But they would take them away from you, wouldn't they?'</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />The reason I think this story is relevant is that this disability support worker did not really know me; she was there to provide a service to me. She did not know anything about my physical abilities really, about my emotional abilities to care for a child, about my financial abilities, yet she saw fit to pass that judgement about me based on an obvious physical difference.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />Similarly, you could argue that an ART provider does not know anything about a person's background, about their reasons for seeking ART to have a child, so why should they be in a position to pass that judgement? Of course, this support worker did not stop me from having children and has no ability to do that, thankfully, but that memory will stay with me, probably for the rest of my life. It may well be that, if and when I have the privilege of having my own children, that story might come back to me with the memory of the doubts, pain and rejection from that day.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />My concern is that, even if a registered objector can state their objection and then refer the client on to someone who might provide those services, that rejection of service initially could cause significant emotional pain and cynicism for people who are already in a pretty vulnerable position, I think it is fair to say, when they are seeking ART services. It is a very emotional and sensitive time. Based on my knowledge and experience and the anecdote that I have just shared, it is clear that there are already enough people facing enough judgement and stigma for wanting to go about living their lives. I cannot sit by and allow more of that stigma and pain to continue, so I will not be supporting these amendments.</span>

As I understand it, the Hon. Dennis Hood's amendment would not assist an organisation such as Repromed if they were not to provide the service. In that sense, if Repromed or any agency only had practitioners who wanted to become registered objectors, they would presumably be under a legal obligation to procure the services of people who do provide the services.</span>

    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">It is a well-established principle that medical practitioners and other health practitioners can on moral grounds, whether that be religious or otherwise, choose not to administer a particular treatment. The Hon. Dennis Hood's amendment sits in a long line of legislative instruments to reflect that value. That does not mean that that bill, for example, was going to allow voluntary euthanasia. Likewise, as I said before, I support this bill opening up surrogacy to same-sex couples, but I do believe it is appropriate to recognise that some medical practitioners and other health professionals may choose not to participate.</span>

        <span class="MemberUpper-H">The Hon. T.T. NGO:</span>  I rise to support the amendments of both the Hon. Ms Franks and the Hon. Mr Hood. I think they are good amendments because, whether we like it or not, there are people in society who have strong religious beliefs. Some honourable members may not think so, but it is their right to have strong religious beliefs. Society has opened up to the world, and migrants are coming here to make their second home, and many have strong religious beliefs. I believe that many migrants do respect same-sex couples even though they have strong religious beliefs.</span>

      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />However, you may have a situation where someone has strong beliefs and, because of their beliefs, they cannot provide that service, and I think we should provide a way out for them. This amendment does that because if someone has strong beliefs, they have to register. They cannot decide on the day or in the moment to say no to that couple. If someone has strong beliefs and they go out of their way to register, we should respect that.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />The amendment does not say, 'That's it. You're not entitled to experience motherhood or fatherhood.' It says that they need to find an alternative provider to assist those couples. I cannot see the problem with that because you are not denying this couple a child. I know other honourable members talked about being discriminated against by airlines or while having a coffee, but those service providers do not discriminate based on disability or sex.</span>

      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />This is all about religion. If someone has a really strong belief and they go out of their way to express their view, then as members of this parliament we should respect that. It may happen every now and then, or it may not, but potentially it may. If we do not fix this up and that happens, it could cause a lot of headaches for innocent people who are happy to provide the service but who, because of their strong beliefs, may potentially end up in court.</span>

In an abundance of caution and for absolute clarity I am very happy to move this amendment.</span>

This is very much the basis around the origins of my moving this legislation a decade ago. I accept the minister's assurance that this was inadvertent. I have my own view in that I think it reflected a bit of the sloppiness of the directions that were coming from the proponents in the other place but, ultimately, the reality is that the very good discussions that I have had with the minister and, I must say, with Professor John Williams, about the ways in which we can correct this have brought us to the point we are at now. I am very grateful that the minister has moved that amendment. I support the amendment and commend it to all other members.</span>

May I also ask a question of the minister. It is a question that I think I asked him a few weeks ago when we met about this bill but I do not recall getting a definitive response. If he could consider it now, if possible, in the spirit of trying to make sure that we are covering everyone possible: would the inability to carry a child to term also include a woman who might technically be able to get pregnant under certain circumstances and carry a child but is not able to get pregnant through intercourse due to conditions such as vaginismus or pelvic floor hyperactivity, which means a woman is unable to or has limited ability to have penetrative sex?</span>

        <span class="MemberUpper-H">The Hon. I.K. HUNTER:</span>  My advice is that, yes, it would. The language that was used in the drafting of this legislation was intended to cover the full gamut of situations but, because it did not explicitly lay out and use the language of the existing legislation, the Hon. Mr Dawkins and I concurred that we should put that example of that language back in. However, in the case that the Hon. Ms Vincent is contemplating, my advice is that it would certainly be covered.</span>

MALINAUSKAS:</span>  I apologise in advance if my ignorance or misinterpretation of this has got the better of me in respect of the intent of this particular amendment.

        <span class="MemberUpper-H">The Hon. I.K. HUNTER:</span>  My answer is in three parts. The first part is that this is just putting back what currently exists in the act. It is currently there. It is not adding in any new provision. What is currently in place is being reinforced by putting the language of the existing act into this bill. Secondly, my understanding is that to access surrogacy arrangements you have to be a couple, so it would not apply to single people, and that is what we are dealing with here—surrogacy. In terms of the broader question about ART, as I said in the earlier part of the debate, single women can now access ART if they are medically infertile.</span>

        <span class="MemberUpper-H">The Hon. S.G. WADE:</span>  I make the point that the amendment in the lower house meant that that portion of the bill would never make it into the act, so I think the minister is correct to tell us that under the current law this medical service is available only to couples. In the future, it will only be available to couples. What this bill does is broaden the range of couples to whom it is available.</span>

        <span class="MemberUpper-H">The Hon. I.K. HUNTER:</span>  I agree with the Hon. Mr Wade on almost every point except the last one. I do not think it does broaden it. I think the words we had in the bill would have covered all situations. The Hon. Mr Dawkins felt otherwise, so out of an abundance of caution I used the existing language. That does nothing whatsoever to change the availability of the legislation to single people.</span>

        <span class="MemberUpper-H">The Hon. S.G. WADE:</span>  Sorry, I meant the effect of the bill overall, not this particular amendment. Just by way of history, the minister was not rushing to put this in. In fact, the minister intended to reassure the council by words on the record and he was happy to take the risk with the courts, so to speak. The Hon. John Dawkins, with my encouragement, agreed with the minister that it would be good to have it in the legislation. Just to clarify some of the comments the minister made yesterday, that was not a reflection on this particular executive, but a reflection of a long-standing tradition of parliaments to trust no executive.</span>

        <span class="MemberUpper-H">The Hon. J.S.L. DAWKINS:</span>  I will be brief, but I want to reassure the Hon. Mr Malinauskas that the legislation is quite clear about who is eligible, and single people are not eligible. But can I go back to the history of this. The Hon. Ms Lensink and I, along with staff representing other members, had a briefing from the minister and a range of officials from various government departments about the four bills. There was an excellent briefing from a representative of the Department of the Premier and Cabinet about this bill. </span>

      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />However, I do remember the words I used, in that I said I did not want to ask a silly question, but I needed to ask it just to ensure that the people who—I used the example of Ms Kerry Faggotter, who came to me originally. She is capable of becoming pregnant but she cannot carry a child to term; there are other women who can probably carry a child to term but it would be medically dangerous for them to do so. I wanted to make sure that those categories of women were still included in the definition of infertility that we had installed in the original legislation. I asked the question, and on the day, the minister and his adviser were of the view that that was covered.</span>

      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />To his great credit, the minister rang me the following afternoon—I remember where I was when he rang me—and told me that the good work, as a follow-up to my question, came up with the information that it was not covered and so he would draft an amendment. He did that very quickly; however, subsequently, we had some conversations about whether we could put a statement in <span class="-H" style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>. We had a meeting with Professor Williams, who subsequently came up with some words.</span>

        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />Ultimately, I was of the view that we were better off to have an amendment. I looked at the amendment that the minister had drafted and was prepared to move that, but subsequently our discussions agreed upon the position that it would be even better if the minister moved it himself. I hope that explains the situation to the Hon. Mr Malinauskas and others. I commend the amendment once again.</span>

This has been particularly evident over the past few days, where we have debated a number of bills that many of us feel passionately about in what I think has been a remarkably respectful manner.</span>

John Dawkins. The job of being whip is often thankless but someone has to do it, so thank goodness for these two blokes because it is much better them than anyone else trying to herd the cats they often have to herd. I would also like to convey my significant admiration to those who have harder jobs still in this place: our excellent table staff Jan Davis, Chris Schwartz, Guy Dickson; our attendants Todd, Super Mario, Karen and Antoni—</span>

Our sincere thanks are extended to them all, as well as to the staff in our own offices, who work long hours to help us do our jobs and ensure that this chamber runs somewhat smoothly.

        <span class="MemberUpper-H">The Hon. K.J. MAHER:</span>  I thank the Hon. David Ridgway for his interjection which I think was something along the lines of, 'That was just my lunch yesterday.' There are some other facts that help to summarise the year in review quite well. I believe the Hon. Robert Brokenshire has mentioned that he used to be the police minister only about 49 times, or about once every sitting day, which is fortunately a third of the number of times he reminded us of this fact last sitting year.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />The Hon. Andrew McLachlan quoted nearly half of the combined complete works of Alfred Lord Tennyson, William Wordsworth, John Keats and Rodney Rude, and occasionally the prose quoted had some relevance to the debate at hand. The Hon. John Gazzola distinguished himself with his speed of speaking, taking an average of only seven seconds to ask each question and would probably win the Rocky Balboa award for elocution.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />The Hon. Stephen Wade has again been able to channel the Incredible Hulk in this chamber, with random outbursts of sudden anger that have equally delighted and scared most of us. Not to be outdone, the Hon. Terry Stephens' vigorous interjections about where we should often go and how we should do it have earned him the title of 'tough cop on the beat' for the Legislative Council. Of course, to you, our glorious President, who has presided over us wisely once again, in a strange sort of karma way you seem to be growing even more hair as the Hon. David Ridgway continues to lose his.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />We saw the welcome addition this year of the Hon. Peter Malinauskas, whose presence in this chamber has brought down the average age of the chamber by some considerable years, and we have seen the triumphant return of the Hon. Michelle Lensink, who continues to very unfairly compare some ministers in this government to cartoon characters.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />On a serious note, I would like to pay tribute to the Hon. Gail Gago, who was the leader of this government in this chamber when we ended last year. Her contribution to all aspects of parliamentary life has been immense, and I am sure that those opposite, like me, miss the cries of 'Shame' during question time.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />We are, of course, grateful for the sheer number of points of order raised by the Hon. John Dawkins during the course of the year, who, as he says, has been here for a very long time and that we should all, quite frankly, know better. There are various levels of gratefulness to the Hon. Jing Lee, who this year has moved a motion about nearly every organisation or international day that was on the calendar.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />Members might not be surprised to hear that the Hon. Rob Lucas took the title for speaking more than any other member of this chamber this year, closely followed by the extraordinary verbosity of the Hon. Mark Parnell during the course of the year. I am advised that the Hon. Rob Lucas' speaking time exceeded the combined total of the Hon. Kelly Vincent, the Hon. John Darley and the Hon. Dennis Hood, who taught us all lessons in succinctness and how to sum up everything you need to say in an amount of time that is probably more appropriate.</span>

        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />The Hon. Tammy Franks has spent more time protesting on the steps than in the chamber, a fact that she ought to be proud of. The Hon. Tung Ngo has spent the most time of anyone singing in this chamber. I will be particularly interested to hear his cover of Bonnie Tyler's <span class="-H" style="font-style:italic;">Total Eclipse of the Heart</span> next year, which I am reliably informed is often done at La Sing in the early hours of the morning.</span>

I wish everyone a very merry Christmas break and particularly a fond farewell to Robert Brokenshire, as he has a keen interest in the workings of the federal parliament. I am keen to finish because apparently the ice-creams are on the Hon. Ian Hunter. If anyone would like a photo with the real Ian Hunter, rather than a cardboard cut-out, I am sure that the Hon. David Ridgway will have his selfie stick available at the back of the chamber once we have finished sitting.</span>

        <span class="GeneralBold-H">):</span>  I stand on behalf of the opposition to endorse some, but not all, of the comments made by the Leader of the Government as we wind up this calendar year of sitting. Certainly, it is refreshing to have a bit of humour. Without reflecting too poorly on previous leaders, I think that is probably the most light-hearted summing up or end of the year speech we have had, so I congratulate the Leader of the Government on a bit of humour at the end of the year.</span>

      <span class="Normal-H">
        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />From a thankyou point of view, on behalf of the opposition I thank all the people in Parliament House and those the minister and Leader of the Government has mentioned: the staff in Parliament House, Hansard, parliamentary counsel, catering staff, kitchen staff, security people and everybody who makes this place function. It does function very well—even on the night the power went out it still functioned reasonably well. We were able to secure all the hot food in the Blue Room for a group in the Hon. Terry Stephens' office, which meant that nobody else could get any, so that worked well that particular night.</span>

I do not think we have had as many late nights this year as we have had in other years. The Leader of the Government is very keen not to sit on any nights, other than when we have urgent business, and I think everybody has been quite happy not to sit late.</span>

        <span style="&#xA;          margin-left:26pt&#xA;        " />I know that the Hon. Michelle Lensink has had some discussions and will have further discussions perhaps over the break with our team about whether we can fine-tune and streamline private members' business and maybe come back to the government and the chamber with some options. I also would like to say that we are thinking of Gerry and his family and, of course, Kyam and his family, as his mother is very ill at the moment, too. Our thoughts are with both those families.</span>

Robert Brokenshire may be gone from this chamber when we resume on 14 February, on Valentine's Day, and of course speculation is rife that the Hon. Peter Malinauskas may make the move to the seat of Croydon over this summer period. He may not. The Hon. Frank Blevins is the only one who has ever actually been successful. A number have tried and failed; whatever may come, we may see him back or we may not. With those few words, I wish everyone a very merry Christmas and a safe and happy new year. We look forward to seeing you back here on Valentine's Day with a lot of love in 2017.</span>

I give a special shout out to the building staff who have the unenviable task of trying to fix the heritage-listed air conditioning (including in my office) over the summer, in the first three weeks of January. I hope that speed is on their side. I look forward to 2017 and hope it will be a better year than 2016.

It has been another big year for the Legislative Council. As the Hon.

It is extraordinary that these things happen without our personal involvement, so a sincere thank you to all the staff. I wish all the members a terrific Christmas. I hope you have a chance to have a break with your families and come back refreshed next year. It is an election year of sorts, that is, we are at least leading to an election, so I think those tempers may fray a bit more, particularly in the second half of the year.</span>
